            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Fifthly, The good and evill of all things is to be judged by the end and iſſue of it; <hi>i'ts better,</hi> becauſe thou entereſt into life; <hi>and it's worſe,</hi> becauſe keeping them thou wilt indanger body and ſoul in hell, Sixthly, <hi>Legal motives are of uſe even to the regenerated,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſtians may uſe them, and not be legal Chriſtians: indeed the more ingenious ſervices are, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and the more freely and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the heart comes off from ſin upon the principles of the Goſpel, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes duty from a ſpirit of love, fearing the Lord and his goodneſs, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying from a cord of love and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, the love of Chriſt conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

               </gap>l tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is <hi>the fire,</hi> the leſs principal, <hi>the worm.</hi> In the words therefore is diſcribed the poſitive part of the torments of hell. Firſt, that which is, Eſſential and principal, the Fire.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93322:7"/>Secondly, That which is leſs Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, the Worm. Thirdly, The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of them both, the fire is never quenched, nor the Worm never dies. I will take them as they lye in the Text, and begin firſt with that which is leſs principal <hi>the Worm,</hi> their worm never dyes.</p>
            <p>Here we may note two things, Firſt, the torment it ſelf, a <hi>Worm.</hi> Secondly, the particularity of the torment, <hi>Their</hi> Worm. Every man ſhall have <hi>his own</hi> Worm. The words are taken out of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.24. The Lord had promiſed the glorious deliverance of the Church, and had threatned the utter deſtruction of his enemies, and when they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, the Saints ſhould look upon them and triumph over them, the Saints ſhall have dominion over them in the morning, and they ſhall go forth in their contemplation, and conſider not only their preſent out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition and miſery, but their eternal condition, <hi>Their Worm never dyes, and their fire is not quenched to all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93322:7"/>Eternity, and they ſhall be an abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring unto all fleſh</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To begin with the Torment it ſelf, it's a <hi>Worm,</hi> which is not to be underſtood literally, but metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally of ſomething that holds ſome reſemblance and ſome analogy to it. Now a Worm in Scripture is put to reſemble two things; Firſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is deſpicable, and to be contemned, fear not thou worm <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</hi> Secondly, ſomething that is tormenting, and continually vexing, <hi>and ſo it's in this place;</hi> here the Phyloſophers tell us <hi>Nihil eſt in intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectu, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore the Lord is pleaſed to help our underſtandings to expreſs ſpiritual things by earthly ſimilitudes and reſemblances; as Chriſt ſaith of the Miſteries of the Goſpel, he could not ſpeak them as they were but by earthly things, that is, in reſpect of the manner of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, though the things were in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſpiritual; and if the Lord do it by things that men have experience of in this life, how much more the things that are reſerved for the World to come, <hi>as the joys of Heaven
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93322:8"/>by all good things, &amp; the torments of hell by all evill things.</hi> Whatever is moſt terrible to ſence, and moſt tormenting as Fire, Brimſtone, darkneſs and a Worm, which are only to help our underſtanding in thoſe things which both paſs fear and knowledge: as after death it is ſet forth as a thing dreadfull to nature, to have worms breed out of a man, and feed upon him;
<note place="margin">Job. 24.20.</note> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>The Worms ſhall feed ſweetly on him, he ſhall be no more remembred, &amp;c.</hi> And the greateſt perſons that have lain upon beds of Ivory, and have had Tapiſtry for their covering, muſt ſay unto the worms ye are my ſiſters; the Moth eats them as a garment, and the Worm devours them as wooll, &amp;c. Now to have theſe bodies that have been cloathed ſumptuouſly, and fed delicately, to be cloathed with worms, and to become their food, is ſad, and even diſmal to nature after a mans diſſolution. But if theſe worms ſhould breed in a man, and feed upon him whilſt he were alive, it would be much more terrible; as it was a torment invented by a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93322:8"/>to keep a man in a Coffin, and feed him, till by his own filth he breed worms, and theſe worms de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured his fleſh, and he dyed by them. The judgement that came upon <hi>Herod</hi> by the immediate ſtroak of an Angel;
<note place="margin">Acts 12.23.</note> and the ſame judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſaid to be inflicted upon <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximinus</hi> the Emperor, that his body putrify'd &amp; bred worms continually. Now this is a fearfull thing, and dreadfull to nature to come upon the body; but what will it be for a worm to be gnawing upon the ſoul for ever? For in reſpect of that fire in Hell, our fire here is but a painted fire; it's true alſo in reference to the Worm therein.</p>
            <p>This being a Metaphorical expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, let us come to open it a little what it is, and wherein the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance doth conſiſt? <hi>This Worm is generally to be underſtood of the furious reflection of the ſoul upon it ſelf,</hi> in conſideration of it's by paſt life, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected opportunities, and it's preſent hopeleſs and unrecoverable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo the tormenting acts of Conſcience upon the man are reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93322:9"/>by the Worm, and the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance lies in two things; Firſt, a Worm is bred out of the putrifaction of the ſubject in which it is; now in the conſcience of men there is much corruption the conſcience is as it were the ſink where all the evil in a man is, there is firſt much of the filthineſs and defilement of ſin in the conſcience, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. Their conſcience is defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
<note place="margin">Mat. 23.27.</note> like whited Sepulchres, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly fair, but inwardly full of rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs and all uncleanneſſe, they may eaſily breed worms.
<note place="margin">Heb. 9.14</note> Secondly, All the guilt of ſin in the ſoul ſettles upon the conſcience, and it needs purging, for all the works done by an unregenerate man are dead works becauſe they proceed from a dead nature, and becauſe they all tend unto death; and though theſe things be the work of the whole ſoul, and every faculty, yet the guilt of them, all is laid upon the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and if there be ſo much fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs and putrifaction both of guilt and defilement in the conſcience, it is no wonder if it breed a worm as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93322:9"/>all other putrifactions do; and this being the worſt, it is not ſtrange if it breed the worſt and the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Worm.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It doth alwayes gnaw upon the ſubject in which it is bred, and ſo it is with this Worm, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes feeding upon the ſoul, and that for ever. For it is with a mans ſpirit as with mill-ſtones, when there is nothing elſe, it grindes it ſelf, &amp;c. Now God will ſtop the current of all the creatures after this life, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.25. There ſhall be nothing from without for the ſpirit of a man to feed upon, and then it will turn in upon it ſelf for ever. <hi>Here, moſt of the acts of a mans ſoul are dire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on objects without him; there are few reflexe acts, man will not turn in upon himſelf; <hi>But then a mans acts ſhall be full of reflection</hi> upon himſelf for ever. Now this furious reflection of the ſoul upon it ſelf, it's own fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs and wilfull folly. What fair offers and opportunities he has had and neglected, what fair hopes he had conceived, and they are vaniſhed; and how all the pleaſures of ſin and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93322:10"/>the promiſes of Satan have deceived him, as a Brook that paſſeth by, and this will gnaw upon the ſoul with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſs and unconceivable torment for ever, <hi>this is the Worm that never dyes;</hi> and truly there is no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the World will work upon the hearts of men, if this dreadfull one does not. That a man that lives and dyes in ſin, in a ſinfull ſtate, ſhall be tormented for ever with fire that ſhall never be quenched, and this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vever dying Worm ſhall gnaw upon him to all Eternity, with remedileſs and unconceivable torments for ever, <hi>This is the Worm that never dyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this life, a wicked mans own Conſcience ſhall be his tormenter;
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
               </label> 
               <hi>The Worm dyes not,</hi> it will be a great inſtrument that God will uſe in a mans deſtruction. There are Four things to be ſpoken to in the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; Firſt, to ſhew what Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is, which is here reſembled to a Worm. Secondly, To prove that this Conſcience ſhall be a mans tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter. Thirdly, To give the grounds and the reaſons of it. Fourthly, To
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93322:10"/>ſet forth ſome of thoſe acts that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as a Worm ſhall put forth; the manner of the working of it in the gnawings of a Worm, and then come to the Application.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Firſt, What is Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. It is an ability in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to judge of a mans ſelf, his Eſtate, and Actions, according to the rule that God hath preſcribed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here obſerve, Firſt, It is an abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the underſtanding; for I make it not, as ſome do, a diſtinct faculty, &amp; therefore it is in no Creatures but thoſe that are reaſonable, Men and Angels; other Creatures are directed to an end, and they work by a rule thereunto; but they neither know their end, nor their rule, neither are they able to reflect upon their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whether they have done good or evil; <hi>and therefore no Creature can ſin but a reaſonable Creature:</hi> for ſin muſt be a tranſgreſſion of a Rule, which a man doth, or ought to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93322:11"/>know, and to walk anſwerable unto; and therefore it is made a proper act of a man, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.8. <hi>Remember this and ſhew your ſelves men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſcience muſt have a rule; indeed the Scripture doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that men ſhould walk accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their conſciences, and do as their Conſcience doth dictate unto them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.5. Wherefore ye muſt needs be ſubject, not only for wrath, but for Conſcience ſake: ye muſt be ſubject <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and when Conſcience requires one thing, and Luſt another, and the man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives not the rule of Conſcience, but of Luſt; he doth then impriſon the truth in unrighteouſneſs, where <hi>the Dictates of Conſcience are called the truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.18.</note> though it be but of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſcience. But yet here men miſtake; for Conſcience is but <hi>regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la regulata,</hi> not the higheſt rule; for it muſt it ſelf have a Rule to judge by;
<note place="margin">Gal 6.16.</note> and he that doth not go by rule, and hath no higher rule to regulate his Conſcience, and yet doth by his Conſcience regulate his Actions, Conſcience being defiled, <hi>Pit.</hi> 1.15.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93322:11"/>He doth walk with God at a venture, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.21. And this rule of Conſcience is the whole revealed wil of God, whether <hi>ex principiis natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae,</hi> or <hi>ſcripturae;</hi> whatever God requires of a man as duty, whether by his word or by his works, and <hi>Conſcience knows no other rule but the will of God revealed,</hi> becauſe it is ſubjected unto no other: God only can command the Conſcience, and bind the Conſcience, becauſe he only can judge the Conſcience. Now the underſtanding having nothing elſe but a principal of nature for it's rule; we call that <hi>a natural Couſcience,</hi> and they that have the word of God for their rule, or any ſpecial work of illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination from the Holy Ghoſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be common or ſaving, we call this <hi>an inlightned Conſcience,</hi> anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto the rule that it has to judge by, either of mens ſtates or wayes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The chief act of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that which is only proper and eſſential to it, is to judge of the man according to this rule, and to pronounce a ſentence upon him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or evil; and hence is the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93322:12"/>accuſing and the excuſing power of Conſcience;
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.14 15.</note> if Conſcience judge of an action to anſwer the rule, then it excuſeth, and if that be different from the rule, then it accuſeth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.9. <hi>They are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinced of their own Conſciences;</hi> that is, their Conſciences laid their acts to the rule, and did tell them that they did not agree to it, and they could not deny it, and therefore went their way; and therefore Conſcience is alwayes in Scripture called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is a knowing and judging of one thing with another; a knowing and judging of a mans ſtate or actions with the rule:
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.2.</note> we approve our ſelves to every mans conſcience, ſays the Apoſtle, in the ſight of God, and that is all our aim: we ſeek not to approve our ſelves to your luſts, your fancies, we may ſometime in our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie reprove ſin that you are not willing to leave, and preſs to duty that you are not willing to practice; we may croſs your affections, and provoke your luſts, but yet we know that <hi>we have ſomething within you that takes our part,</hi> and doth approve the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93322:12"/>Doctrine that we teach, and the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that we practice all the while; ſo that the main of Conſcience lyes in judging or applying an action to the rule, and pronouncing a ſentence accordingly. So that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. <hi>Judge your ſelves, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Judge I pray between me and my Vineyard.</hi> So that Conſcience is an ability in a man, having a rule given him to reflect upon his actions and ſtate, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>udge whether it agree with the rule that is given to it or no.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. That which is ſubjected to the judgement of Conſcience, is a mans ſtate and wayes, the whole man. To judge other men, is not properly our work, either their actions or ſtates, unleſs we are called by ſpecial Office thereunto; for thou judgeſt another mans ſervant, he ſtands and falls to his own Maſter. But a <hi>mans whole</hi> ſelf is ſubjected to the judgement of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſcience judges of a mans ſtate, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20. If thy heart condemn thee or do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thee; and <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.24. The Word doth ſhew a man what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93322:13"/>of man he is, and in what ſtate he ſtands towards God; whether he be one of the wiſe, or fooliſh Virgins, or builders; whether he build upon a Rock or the Sand. Now conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience takes this rule, and lays a <hi>mans ſtate to it,</hi> and tels the man this is my condition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſcience judges of mens actions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1. <hi>I ſpeak the truth, I lye not, my Conſcience bearing me witneſs;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> I do not ſpeak this with my mouth, and my conſcience gives me the lye, but Conſcience ſpeaks the ſame thing, and joint with me in the teſtimony. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. This is our rejoycing, the teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſincerity we have had our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in the World; but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to you-ward, &amp;c. Conſcience brings his carriage towards them to the rule, and judges of it, to agree, and to be conſonant thereunto; and therefore gives teſtimony within him and into this Court the ſpirit of God commonly comes to aſſiſt conſcience, to pronounce the ſentence. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93322:13"/>is defiled, and ſo over-awed, and bribed, and blinded by luſt, that it cannot many times pronounce a right ſentence; till the Spirit of God comes into the Court and acts Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and cauſeth it to judge aright of his eſtate and and wayes alſo, and therefore <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1. My conſcience bears me witneſs in the Holy Ghoſt, the Holy Ghoſt doth witneſs with Conſcience, and Conſcience in the power of the Spirit does witneſs to the man; ſo in a wicked man it is a Spirit of bondage, that is, does cauſe Conſcience to witneſs bondage, which elſe by reaſon of the ſelf love and ſelf flattery that is in the man, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do; and in a godly man it wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth grace and adoption, which of it ſelf it can never do; and therefore the ſpirit is a witneſs in Heaven, and in earth alſo, <hi>even in a renewed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> the ſpirit does <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. We come now to give the reaſons or the grounds of the point which will be beſt done by anſwering theſe Queſtions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As inordinate love unto a mans ſelf, has been the great cauſe of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93322:14"/>all a mans ſins, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2, So it is ſelf loathing that is the cauſe of all a mans Torment, a man ſhall be a burden to himſelf, <hi>Job</hi> 7.20. A ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to himſelf. <hi>Jer.</hi> 20, 4. As by ſelf love they have corrupted themſelves; ſo by ſelf loathing, they ſhall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment themſelves for ever; and ſo the Lord will take the ſame way in puniſhing, that they have taken in ſinning. That the ſin that a man hath here taken moſt pleaſure in, ſhal hereafter be to him the matter of his his greateſt torment; as we ſee it here, immediately as ſoon as God does awaken the Conſcience: there is no ſin ſo dreadful to a man as his darling, and he fears nothing like that which he has moſt loved and deſired: ſo it will be hereafter in a mans pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment alſo, as nothing was ſo loved, admired, and deifi'd as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſo there ſhall be nothing that he ſhall loath and abhor like himſelf for ever; and anſwerable to a mans ſelf love, ſo will his ſelf loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be, for <hi>Revel.</hi> 8.8. ſo much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſo much torment. No ſin wil will pierce <hi>Herods</hi> heart, like to his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93322:14"/>
               <hi>rodias.</hi> And there is no ſin that a man ſpares more here than his dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and there is none will be more cruel to them hereafter, and as a worm, feed upon their hearts, and eat up their inward man for ever; and ſo it is in it ſelf alſo, as there is nothing they have loved more, and ſpared more here, they have wholly been cruel unto others, but unto themſelves ſparing: they ſhall not be ſo hereafter, but above all others they ſhall be cruel to themſelves for ever.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 2d. Secondly, <hi>Seeing God will torment a man by himſelf, why is the main of a mans torment in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience above all other faculties? It is true, that as every faculty hath been filled with the fruits of all unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, ſo every faculty ſhall be a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel filled with wrath, but above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, why the Worm in the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, Becauſe it is the ſpirit of the man, and that wherein his main ſtrengh lyes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:93322:15"/>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe it is the tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt part of the ſoul, it's reſembled to the eye, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.3. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt ſenſible, it is capable of more torment than any other of the faculties and powers of the ſoul what ſoever.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There the Lord will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the puniſhment, where the ſin mainly is; now of all the faculties of the ſoul, there is none ſo defiled as the Conſcience, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. For the guilt of all the ſins of the whole ſoul is there.
<note place="margin">Jer. 17.1</note> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.4. There are the Treaſures of ſin; therefore there wil the Lord power out the Treaſures of wrath, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 3. Thirdly, <hi>But if the Lord will torment the Conſcience why doth not the torment reſt there? But he will make that the inſtrument to torment the whole man. Why ſhall that do it rather than the wil or affections? &amp;c. But the torment of the whole ſoul muſt come in by the Conſcience: this is the Flood gate, or as I may call it, the Funnel of wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:93322:15"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, Becauſe God has given unto Conſcience he greateſt honour in the ſoul, and has exalted it above all other powers and abilities of the ſoul whatſoever. The main of the Image of God was ſtampt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it at firſt, if we judge by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of it, for the great effect of redemption is there. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. And of renovation: alſo <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4 23. It is called the Spirit of the mind, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. The Spirit. <hi>Pro.</hi> 18.14. It is to be referred <hi>ad illam partem que nobiliſſima eſt. Calv</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore the main work of Sanctification lies in the Conſcience, a pure Conſcience. Now the Image of God in Sanctification is renewed, therefore where this Image is moſt renewed, there it was moſt planted: for we are renewed according to the Image of him that created us. And the main thing that God reſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>s in all Ordinances,
<note place="margin">Heb. 9 8.</note> is to make the man perfect according to his Conſcience; and that is <hi>Conſcientiam puram &amp; pacatam r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ddere,</hi> to pacifie it, and purifie it, this is the perfection of the Conſcience, and the perfection of the

God will turn a mans glory into ſhame, and that which ſhould have been his perfection, that ſhall become his torment for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſcience has the greateſt Office, and power, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the ſoul, it is Gods Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent; every man is as it were a petty Kingdome; and as God has ſet Princes upon earth in their ſeveral Kingdomes, ſo he has in the man alſo, and he has committed unto Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the whole Law of God, and the whole duty of man and Conſcience is that in joyns it upon all the faculties, and that ſees it executed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13 5. You muſt be ſubject, that is not only <hi>ratione externae coactionis,</hi> but <hi>internae obligationis.</hi> Conſcience is ſubject unto none but God; but the whole ſoul is put in ſubjection unto the Conſcience<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and let men, the greateſt upon earth command, yet if Coſcience gives it <hi>non plaeet,</hi> it is no law in the man, it ſhall, never be obeyed, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.17.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93322:16"/>
               <hi>be it known unto thee, O King we will not ſerve thy gods,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.20. We cannot but ſpeak, a neceſſity is laid upon me, I muſt preach, &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 20, 9. The Word was in him as fire, he could not forbear, it is the impulſe of Conſcience; that was the cauſe there is a double neceſſity, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terna &amp; interna, &amp;c.</hi> Now accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto this order and ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the faculties, ſo ſhall the torment be; Conſcience is ſubject to none but God, therefore the ſpirit of bondage ſhall come into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and trouble that, and this ſhall torment the whole man, and as God does uſually ſet up Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and they become Inſtruments of wrath over the kingdoms where they dwell; if they be good, they are a ſpecial bleſſing, they are the breath of our Noſtrils, the ſtay of our Tribes, the Chariots and Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; but if they be wicked, they ruine the kingdom: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.3. <hi>Saul</hi> had even deſtroyed the Nation, they are ravening Lyons, and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wolves, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.3. So it is in the government of the inward man,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93322:17"/>if the Conſcience be good its the greateſt bleſſing, and if evil the greateſt curſe; for as none has the Power, the Authority, and the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to undo a people, like thoſe that have the Rule over them; ſo it is with the Conſcience, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath that Authority and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertunity to undo a man like it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is alwayes with him, where ſoever he goes, and therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> great is that darkneſs?</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:93322:17"/>
            <p>Secondly, Conſcience is dead, a ſpirit of ſlumber is upon it, that though it know things to be evil, yet it ſtirs not againſt them; or if it does, it is but faintly; but a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience exerciſeth Authority over the whole man, and ſmites him when ever he does evil: as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.17.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is erroneous, and carries men unto evil violently, under a pretence of good, a zeal not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to knowledg; <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.2. For zeal perſecuting the Church; <hi>Tantus eram Saulus,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat he thought him worthy of eternal death, that deſcented from the Authority of his Religion in any thing; it is from a deceived heart, an erroneous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Conſcience will be bribed by Luſt, takes in carnal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and corrupt principles, and will be ſatisfied in them, <hi>Rom</hi> 1. impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons truths in unrighteouſneſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. And it is inſenſible of any thing, and it is juſt with God, that that Officer in the man, that had the great hand in corrupting, ſhould alſo
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93322:18"/>have the great hand in tormenting the whole man.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 4. Fourthly, <hi>Why is not Conſcience a Worm here, as well as hereafter in Hell?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe Conſcience cannot work of it ſelf, unleſs the Spirit of God awaken it, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here is the working time of Conſcience, its ſuffering time ſhall be hereafter; Here Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience has great workes to do, and great talents to imploy; <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18. The charge of the whole Life lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Conſcience, and the Lord ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> here a great houſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.20. Underſtand it of the World, or of the Church, yet he has in it Veſſek of Honour, and ſome to Diſhonour. Now, Why does God ſuſpend the torment of the Devils? It is becauſe Chriſt has much work for them to do, and they would have no pleaſure in Sin, if their Torments were fuller; ſo it is with wicked men alſo, and therefore the Lord has appointed a working time for Conſcience to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93322:18"/>its viatory office, and he has a pointed a ſuffering time for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience allo, and he will not Torment them before that time.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hereby the Lord does exalt his own patience and long ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much the more, for Sin being an infinite evil, and a man that is but duſt to provoke God to his Face, and to do it the rather becauſe God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears them, and ſin the more becauſe God forbears them, and becauſe of his patience; becauſe ſentence is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the hearts of the children of men are fully ſet to do evil, now that God ſhould bear with much patience, and long ſuffering the veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction; and that the Lord ſhould not ſtretch forth his own hand againſt them, but that he ſhould alſo ſuſpend the working of their one Conſciences, and ſhould not let looſe the reins upon them, which would bring them down in the midſt of their galantry, as <hi>Belſhazer, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix, Judas, &amp;c.</hi> And that God ſhould keep a hand upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and withhold their own
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93322:19"/>thoughts from flying upon them, it does wonderfully ſet forth the patience of God; The Lord knows how to reſerve the wicked to the day of wrath.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Many things here which ſtop the mouth of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſhall hereafter be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and then Conſcience will ſpeak; The Worm of Conſcience is to the Soul, as they ſay the diſeaſe of the Wolf is to the Body; If it be fed with ſomething from without, will eat the leſs inwardly, but take away all ſupplies from without, and it deſtroys inwardly (as all the good things of this Life will be gone) and then the Soul turns in upon it ſelf and will be its own Tormentor fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> were written in the Books, according to their works.</hi> It is an alluſion to the day of judgment, That's granted by all, The books opened, are Firſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93322:19"/>the book of the Law and Goſpel; Secondly, of Gods Omniſciency; Thirdly, of his Decre; Fourthly, the book of Conſcience: All thoſe ancient Records that lay hid as Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in the dark,
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.15.16.</note> or as ſomething that is written with the juice of a Lemon; you may read it when you bring it to the fire, but not till then.</p>
            <p>But we will now ſet forth thoſe Tormenting acts of Conſcience here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, which ſhall be as the gnawings of this never dying worm, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come to ſpeak unto them perticularly, it's neceſſary that theſe four things be premiſed; Firſt, That <hi>after this Life the Spirit of God ſhall come into the Conſcience of a wicked man, as a ſpirit of bondage fully, for ever.</hi> Conſcience is but a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate power, and acts allways with reference to a higher Law as a rule, and a higher power as a Judge, it is <hi>Regnum ſub graviore Regno;</hi> And therefore it never works by it ſelf alone, but it doth <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and hence it is that the ſame thing hath ſuch different ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93322:20"/>upon the ſpirits of men; There were many in the company of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazar</hi> when the hand-wrighting apeared,
<note place="margin">Dan. 5.5.6.</note> and yet none that we read of, was affected with it but the King; and it was not the hand-wrighting that troubled him, but at the ſame time the ſpirit of God did come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Conſcience; and his own thoughts troubled him, ſtir'd up and acted his Conſcience, and they ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enly terriſie him as the word doth here ſignify. And <hi>

               </note> And who has power over the ſpirits of a man? It is ſubject unto none but God, and the ſpirit of God; and therefore none is able to wound the ſpirit of a man, no more then they can command it, without the ſpirit of God come in with it; Therefore one man is moved by a threatning, and another man is not; one man is pricked in his heart, and the other feels it not; <hi>It is as t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e ſpirit of God doth come into the Conſcience of men.</hi> Now as there is a twofold Covenant, ſo there is a twofold Spirit; That is,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93322:20"/>in reſpect of the double effect that the ſpirit of God works upon the ſpirits of men; for every man hath the ſpirit of God working in him, anſwerable to the Covenant under which he ſtands. Chriſt having the adminiſtration of both Covenants, the Covenant of grace, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works; and the ſpirit of Chriſt, being the Prorex of Chriſt in the adminiſtration of all things in his kingdom, the ſpirit that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies the firſt Covenant, and works in all that are under it, is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. But the ſpirit that acompanies the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, and works in all thoſe whoſe Covenant is changed, is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.45. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. And <hi>the liberty or the bondage of a mans ſpirit lies mainly in his Conſcience.</hi> The ſpirit of God coming in to a mans Conſcience gives him boldneſs, and a manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction into the preſence of God; the boldneſs of a man that has a ſpirit of adoption,
<note place="margin">Job 2</note> it makes him lift up his face in the preſence of God; and the ſpirit coming into a mans heart as a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93322:21"/>ſpirit of Bondage, it caſts upon a man chains of darkneſs. <hi>Jude</hi> 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15.</p>
            <p>Now, As here in this life, the ſpirit of God as a ſpirit of Sonſhip and Adoption comes into the ſoul but by degrees, and we do but receive the firſt fruits; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. The earneſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 9.4. All is but as a ſpark to the Fire, a drop to the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and the ſpirit of God works and withdraws it ſelf, and the man is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted; ſo now the coming of the ſpirit of God into the Conſcience, is but a pledge, and the firſt fruits of wrath which now a man receives; but in the firſt fruits, in a weak mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and with much intermiſſion, <hi>We have our well, and our ill dayes, &amp;c.</hi> And men have their deverſions, notwithſtanding the pangs of their Conſciences; <hi>Caine</hi> can build Cities, to drown the cry of Conſcience; but hereafter as the ſpirit of God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhall be perfectly a ſpirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, ſo in Hell it ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly a ſpirit of Bondage and Fear; and that without intermiſſion or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terception for ever.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:93322:21"/>
            <p>Secondly, After this Life Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhall be perfectly inlightned, and perfectly awakened; There are two great evils that hinder the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Conſcience in this Life.</p>
            <p>Firſt, A blindneſs, and that both ſinful and penal; <hi>Luk</hi> 19.11. They would not know the things of their peace, in the day of their peace; therefore they were now hid from their eyes; and ſo men go hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winckt to Hell, and fall into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, ere they apprehend their danger. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.8. Will a man rob God? &amp;c. And they ſay where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in have we rob'd thee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.11. The hand of the Lord is lifted up, but <hi>they will not ſee:</hi> and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.20. They <hi>call evil good, and good evil; put darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs;</hi> and they <hi>Math.</hi> 6.7. Did think they had prayed well, when they babled much, for they did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be heard for it; and ſo there is a great deal of blindneſs, that does ſeaſe upon men Judicially. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is alſo a ſpirit of ſtumber, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.10. The word
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93322:22"/>in the Hebrew, is the ſame that is uſed of <hi>Adam,</hi> when God took out a rib from him. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.21. Let God threaten judgment and terrour out of his word, and the man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakes not, but is in a deep ſleep ſtill; But there are ſome ſpiritual Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are alſo eternal, a man being forſaken of God, and God leaving him to the willful wickedneſs of his own ſpirit; But there are ſome that are but temporal, and only for the time of this Life; God gives men over to <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and the Fool ſays there is no God: <hi>But though there are Atheiſts here, there are no Atheiſts in Hell;</hi> God gives men o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to blindneſs here, that they will not ſee that ſin is ſo great an evil, and the wrath of God is ſo dreadful as it is; But they ſhall ſee, and the blindneſs of their minds ſhall be done away, and they ſhall be awakned, and the ſpirit of ſlumber removed, and Conſcience ſhall never ſleep again.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, All the faculties of the ſoul ſhall be inlarged; here they are ſtreightned by ſin, and are of a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row capacity, and it is little either
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93322:22"/>joy, or ſorrow, that they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of; alſo Conſcience renewed is capable of a little Grace, there is an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a meaſure, a pitch to which they come, and that is but little, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be tranſlated to Glory, it is but a taſte, that the Lord is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, it is but the firſt fruits of the ſpirit; but after this life, <hi>all the faculties ſhall be inlarged,</hi> that they ſhall be made veſſels prepared for Glory; So wicked men, <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> they are capable of a little wrath here, as a man cannot ſee God and live, he is not capable of the glory of Heaven; ſo neither is a man capable of the torments of Hell and live a child; is capable of more wrath in Hell, then the wickedeſt man that ever was whileſt he lived here; therefore they ſhall be <hi>veſſels fitted for deſtruction. &amp;c.</hi> And hence it is that men cannot call to mind the offers of grace and opertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities neglected, rejected motions, the duties omited, the ſins commited, Sermons heard, the truths that were offered to be diſpoſed, the ſeveral checks of a mans own Conſcience,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93322:23"/>and the ſeveral admonitions of friends, reproaches of enemies, &amp;c. A man cannot conceive how it ſhould be, but then our faculties ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and we ſhall put off our houſes of Clay, by which the ſoul is ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and it ſhall be converſant no more about theſe ſtreightned ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but about the vaſt things of Eternity for ever; The things of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity paſs knowledg and paſs fear. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. This life in grace is but childhood to Heaven, the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and abilities of our ſouls are ſtreightned, <hi>ſo this life in ſin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, is but childhood unto Hell;</hi> for there ſhall the ſoul be inlarged; for God has made the ſoul capable of greater joyes, and greater ſorrows; greater bleſſings, and greater ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings then there are in this Life; and he would never have prepared ſuch veſſels either for wrath, or glory, but that he means to fill them, and this inlargement ſhall be by degrees, as he will fill them by degrees; and as grace inlarges and prepares the heart for glory,
<note place="margin">Col. 1.12.</note> ſo does ſin inlarge and prepare the heart for wrath:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93322:23"/>and therefore they are ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23. To be veſſels fited for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as well as prepared for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, After this Life all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable affections and actings of the ſoul ſhall have an end; There be ſome acts of ſoul that are comforting and cheering, and there are ſome acts that are afflicting and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the comforting acts are in ref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to good things, either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or to come; if preſent the ſoul loves them, and rejoyceth in them, and if abſent, the ſoul loves them, deſires them, and hopes for them, and all theſe do cheer the ſoul, and in the exerciſe of theſe, the life of the ſoul comes in; but <hi>after this Life, all good things of this Life, in preſent fruition, or future reverſion ſhall have an end</hi> From the creatures, all good things at Death ſhall take their leave, they are but this worlds goods; and for all good things from God there ſhall be none, for they ſhall have Judgment without mercy, pure and utter darkneſs, there ſhall not be a beam of light, or the hope of any
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93322:24"/>good thing for the ſoul to live upon unto Eternity; for if a man were to lye in Hell a million of years, and were to expect then a releaſe, his ſoul would live; but being ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in eternity of miſery without hope, the ſoul dyes. Theſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall ſtill remain in the ſoul, but becauſe they have no object, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall never be exerciſed as fear and ſorrow are in the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but never are exerciſed becauſe there is no object upon which it ſhould be exerciſed: Therefore in Hell there never ſhall be an act of love, or joy, or hope more to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; the hope of the wicked, is as the giving up of the Ghoſt, he breaths it out with his laſt breath, and he ſhall never hope more for ever; and there are in the ſoul ſome tormenting and afflicting acts, in reference unto evil things, preſent or to come; if it be preſent there is ſorrow, and if to come fear, and if it be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as an inſuportable and inſeparable, no way to eſcape it, there is diſpair for ever. Now ſeeing there ſhall be the abſence of all good at preſent and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93322:24"/>in hope, and the preſence of all evil, and a mans condition under it help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and hopeleſs, therefore after this life to ungodly men, all comforting acts of ſoul ſhall ceaſe, and all the tormenting acts ſhall take place, and act in their full power and vigour for ever.</p>
            <p>Now let us come to the particulars wherein Conſcience doth apear to be a worm after this life; manely, There is a four fold act of Conſcience, and in every one of them, it does here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after become a worm. Firſt, There is an act of Accuſation, Secondly of Conviction, Thirdly of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Fourthly of Execution; The torments that follow the ſoul after all theſe, and in theſe does this furious reflection of the ſoul upon it ſelf conſiſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, An act of accuſation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. Conſcience accuſing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing, and this conſiſts in two things; Firſt, A reviewing and reflecting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the rule that a man did, and ſhould have walked in. Secondly, Upon the unanſwerableneſs of a mans wayes unto this rule, and ſo Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93322:25"/>ſhall charge upon a man all the errours of his way, for an accuſation does ſuppoſe and lay down a Law, and then charges a man with the breach thereof; there is a double book of Conſcience, the firſt is a book of precepts and rules, ſecondly a book of practiſes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For the book of rules and precepts, there ſhall be manifeſted three things after this life; Firſt, There are many rules of duty that we are ignorant of, and ſo there are many ſins of ignorance committed that men know not to be a ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are unacquainted with the rule of duty, for we know in part, and prophecy in part, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. There is a vail upon the hearts of men in many things, that they know not what they do. Now to this end, the book of Law and Goſpel ſhall be opened, and thereby a mans Duty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and Conſcience inlightned in thoſe things which here it never knew,
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.16.</note> for he will judge the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of all men according unto my Goſpel. &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:93322:25"/>
            <p>Secondly, There are ſeveral ſins commited out of errour and miſtake, and upon falſe rules; The Lord will bring forth and diſcover unto a man, all theſe falſe and erroneous principles, by which he has been led in his whole courſe,
<note place="margin">John 16.2. 1 Cor. 2.8.</note> had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory;
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.2.</note> they have a zeal but not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to knowledg, many things they did from an erroneous Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, now all theſe falſe principles that miſlead a man in his wayes ſhall be brought forth alſo, and the falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of them diſcovered.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There are many true principles which Conſcience does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive here from the word, and the miniſtery thereof which are called truth; <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. Who withhold the truth in unrighteouſneſs: All theſe rules in their authority, holineſs and equity ſhall be ſet before a man, and how all of them were required of man for his good.</p>
            <p>Thus the book of precepts being opened, and the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience inlarged, now follow; the opening of the ſecond book, and that is that of practiſes.</p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:93322:26"/>
            <p>Firſt, Conſcience does charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a man ſins of ignorance, this thou haſt done through ignorance of ſuch a rule, as <hi>Paul</hi> knew not Luſt to be a ſin, before that the Commandment ſaid thou ſhalt not Luſt; and then thy ignorance ſhall be diſcovered unto thee before men and angels, and that with all thy means, and opertunities of knowledg, you to whom the Lord wrote the great things of his Law, that had the Scriptures in your own Language, and freedom and liberty to uſe them, you that had all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of helps, publickly, and private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, preaching and writing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in men do <hi>tranſcribere aias;</hi> you that dwelt in the valley of <hi>Viſion,</hi> and yet of theſe things you are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ignorant, and in the things you know not, in them you have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted your ſelves; now they that counted it matter of ſhame to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by a miniſter, and matter of ſcorn to be examined by him, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leaſt they ſhould bewray their ignorance; God will charge it upon thy Conſcience, and make thee bear the ſhame of it before men and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93322:26"/>thoſe ſins thou haſt commited, and thoſe things thou haſt omited out of ignorance, that ſuch rules thou oughteſt to have known.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Lord will charge upon a man the ſins that he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon falſe and eroneous principles; Thou haſt called the proud happy, and becauſe they that hate the Lord are exalted, therefore thou haſt fallen upon thoſe wayes, and thought their way to be the onely way to peace and proſperity; thou haſt thought Uſury, Sabbath breaking, petty oathes, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious lyes, were little or nothing, and that if a man performed the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward duties of Religion, went to Church, and heard a Sermon, and kept himſelf unſpotted before men, and walked lovingly amongſt his neighbours, <hi>this was enough to bring him to Heaven,</hi> and that what was more, was but either needleſs ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloſity, or affected ſingularity, which is but hypocriſie; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou haſt counted religious men the preciſe fools of the time, when thou haſt ſeen them, with <hi>Dives</hi> as a <hi>Lazarus,</hi> at thy door and regarded
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93322:27"/>them not; but men ſhall recant their corrupt opinions, and publiſh their retractations, and be aſhamed of them before Men and Angels, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21. thou thoughteſt wickedly that I was ſuch a one as thy felf, but I will reprove <hi>thee and ſet</hi> them in order before thine eyes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſcience ſhall charge a man with the Truths he knew and impriſon'd, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. laſt and 2.1. who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit ſuch things, are worthy of death, not only do the ſame, but have pleaſure in them that do them: therefore thou art inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; thou kneweſt this to be a ſin, and yet commitedſt it, and ſuch as thing to be a duty, and yet neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectedſt it, and then all a mans omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſions and comiſſions, ſins of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and wilfulneſs or errour ſhal be charged upon him.</p>
            <p>And here are three things in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner that ſhall be charged. Firſt, in this life our memories are frail,
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.5.</note> and we let things ſlip out of them. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1. and ye have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the exaltation which, &amp;c.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93322:27"/>We forget that we hear; but there ſhall be no forgetfulneſs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; Conſcience ſhall record all the rules of duty in their order. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<note place="margin">Iſ. 50 17.</note> Here there are manifold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of our thoughts, and men do caſt theſe rules of duty and their ſins againſt them behind their backs; but it ſhall then be ſo ſet before a man, that it ſhall be his ſtudy for ever, and he ſhall never be able to turn from it; Conſcience ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſet his ſins before him, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaid, my ſin is ever before me. Thirdly, There is this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this life and the life to come, here theſe rules are ſet before a man that he might learn and obey them; but hereafter they are ſet before him to throw the neglect of them upon him, that he might be upbraided with the guilt of them for ever,
<note place="margin">Job 27.22.</note> and <hi>Job</hi> 27.6. that our hearts might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach us for ever; there is a great deal of difference between the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of a father, telling the ſon his duty, or of a miniſter inſtructing a man, and between a judg, telling a malefactor his ſin and his duty;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93322:28"/>
               <hi>the one doth it in order to his direction and reformation, and the other doth it in order to his execution and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,</hi> that he may ſee and be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced, that the judgment and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence paſt upon him is juſt, and to lay the guilt of his own <hi>deſtruction upon his own</hi> head for ever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, an act of conviction; here if ſin be charged upon men, every man hath a Counſellor within his own breaſt to plead for him, which is his own carnal reaſon, and that does many times ſeek to excuſe <hi>à toto,</hi> and the man pleads not guilty, as <hi>David</hi> for the death of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam,</hi> 11.25. and <hi>Pilate</hi> gives ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt Chriſt, and yet excuſes himſelf that he had nothing to do with the blood of this juſt man, and the Phariſies and Prieſts, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.28. they had no hand in the death of Chriſt: and therefore they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſ'd that the Apoſtles had filled <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with their doctrine, and intend to bring this mans blood upon us, <hi>(reatum &amp; invidiam mortis Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti,)</hi> or elſe it minceth the matter and excuſeth <hi>à tanto,</hi> if it be evil,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93322:28"/>yet not ſo great an evil; for it is the common cuſtom, <hi>Act.</hi> 28.22. it is a ſect ſpoken againſt every where, &amp;c. and by after inconveniencies, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.48 elſe the <hi>Romans</hi> will come and deſtroy place and Nation; and ſo many plead for Ale-houſes, Game-houſes, Play-houſes, a trade of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and uſury for Widows and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, how ſhall they live elſe? and a ſubtile diſtinction for ſwearing, <hi>Mat</hi> 23.16. ſwear by the Temple, for men to ſwear it is nothing; but who ever ſhall ſwear by the Gold of the Temple, he is a debtor; ſo we hear men ſay, to ſwear by God it's a ſin, we will allow to be ſomething, but to ſwear by Faith and Troth, by light, &amp;c. by Creatures, is no evil, as <hi>Judg.</hi> 21.22. they elude their vow, by ſaying we did not give them, but they did take them, with our knowledge and conſent, &amp;c. and with ſuch kind of pleas, as an ignorant judge is blinded by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleties of his Counſel; caſting a var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh over an evil cauſe, and drawing a Cobweb <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>awn over it; ſo is Conſcience alſo: But after this life
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93322:29"/>all theſe pleas ſhall vaniſh, and men ſhall be convicted of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, that they ſhall have nothing to ſay for themſelves; a man ſhall be ſpeechleſs,
<note place="margin">Mat 22.12</note> he ſhall have no cloak for his ſin, <hi>John</hi> 15.22. he was without an excuſe or apologie, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.19. <hi>a Deus foras in crepabit, &amp; conſcientia intus accuſabit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Greg.</note> there ſhall be on means either to deny it or extenuate it; for 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. we are made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt unto God, and I truſt unto your Conſciences, and this Conſcience ſhall do by ſetting before a man. Firſt, The unreaſonableneſs of ſin, <hi>Jer</hi> 2.13. that I did forſake the Fountain of living water, and digged to my ſelf broken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſterns, ſo fooliſh was I, and as a beaſt before thee. Secondly, The cauſeleſneſs of it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.5. what iniquity have your fathen found in me, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6 3. oh my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, what have I done to you? te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify againſt me, have I been a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs? Thirdly, God did forbear me with much patience, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5. did not cut me down, but ſpared me this year alſo, and I had <hi>horae pluſquam amenae nunquam rediturae,</hi> &amp;c. 4ly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93322:29"/>from ſeveral inducements to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the compaſſionate calls of God,
<note place="margin">Act. 20.31</note> oh <hi>Ephraim</hi> what ſhall I do unto thee; my repentings are kindled within me, Chriſt weeps over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and his miniſters ſhed tears, the promiſes of God, and the ſociety of the faithful, &amp; the incouragements you might have from them, you lived amongſt the wiſe Virgins, &amp; <hi>yet in a</hi> land of uprightneſs, they will do wickedly. Fifthly, from the unprofitableneſs of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.22. what fruit have you of that whereof you are now aſhamed, and the ſeveral inconveniencies that thou haſt met with, in a way of ſinning, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.6. ſometimes the Angel meets thee, as it did <hi>Balam,</hi> as it were with a ſword in his hand, to ſtop thee, and yet thouwaſt as a wild Aſſe that knew no bounds, had no bridle: and therefore now ye eat the fruit of your own ways, and are filld with your own devices; for you are one of them that have loved <hi>death, Pro</hi> 8. laſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, an act of condemnation, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.21.
<note place="margin">Tit. 3.11.</note> if our hearts condemn us, God is greater then our hearts, &amp;c. he is condemned of himſelf;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93322:30"/>Conſcience paſſeth the ſentence of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal death upon a mans ſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.4. I have ſin'd, and having been his own judge, he doth quickly become his own executioner, and ſo <hi>Spira</hi> hence Apoſtate, &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.27. There is a receiving of judgment in a mans ſelf, and upon this act the ſoul looks upon it ſelf even in Hell already, he caſts down the 30. pieces <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſpurnes at Gold, and his ſoul abhors dainty meats, his life draws near the grave, and his ſoul to the deſtroyers, he looks every day when the Devil ſhall be ſent as the executioner to ſetch away his ſoul, oh ſays he, that I had been made a Dog, a Toad, and that I could creep into my firſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, rather then have lain under the weight of eternal wrath for ever. I envy the caſe of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> &amp;c. But there is a great deal of difference between the <hi>condemnation</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience here, and hereafter.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Here it does condemn for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſins, as we ſee in <hi>Judas</hi> for his treaſon, in <hi>Spyra</hi> for his apoſtacy, &amp;c. but hereafter it ſhall condemn a man for all his ſins at once; for they ſhall
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93322:30"/>be all ſet in order before him, and ſhall be always before his eyes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. the book of conſcience ſhall be opened, and all the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations of conſcience ſhall be opened, and all the former condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Conſcience ſhall be ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man, and the judgment of God confirming all theſe, and if the condemnation for one ſin be ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, what will it be <hi>for all ſins</hi> when they ſhall be all charged on a man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here conſcience condemns but now and then, &amp;c. and when it does ſo then <hi>Felix</hi> trembles, this ſtrikes a terrour into the center of the ſoul, but hereafter it ſhall always condemn thee, and ſhall give thee no reſpite, thou ſhalt turn in upon thy ſelf, and hear nothing but the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of thy own Conſcience for ever; for as it never dyes, ſo it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſleeps, but ever wakes to torment thee.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Here though Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence condemns a man to death; yet there may be an appeal and a hope of pardon; for here mercy rejoyceth
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93322:31"/>over judgment; but hereafter the judgment of Conſcience ſhall follow the final judgment of God, and the judgment of the Lord and of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhall ſtand.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Here though Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence condemns a man, yet there is a reprival a while, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7. ſin lyer at the door, but the door is ſhut and does not break in upon men, but then the condemnation ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follow'd with the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, go ye curs'd, and immediately tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſhalt lye under this ſentence for ever.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, from hence there doe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ariſe in the ſoul perfect ſorrow, this life is a ſtate of imperfection, but i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93322:31"/>is but the firſt fruits of that harveſt of wrath which men ſhall reap according as they have ſowen, here afflictions are only the beginning of ſorrow, <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum eſt cui nihil deeſt,</hi> ſo there ſhall be nothing wanting unto a mans ſorrow for ever, there ſhall be perfect ſorrow, &amp;c. this perfection of ſorrow is ſet forth to us in Scripture in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Mat. 8.12.</note> By the ſeveral dreadfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of it. There ſhall be utter darkneſs; As the happineſs of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in Scripture, is compared unto light, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. the inheritance of the Saints in light, as light in Scripture is put for all comforts, happineſs, and ſweetneſs: ſo is darkneſs for all miſery and affliction, and it ſhall be utter darkneſs, <hi>purae tenebrae,</hi> the fulneſs of all miſery; there ſhall not be ſo much as a beam of light, and comfort to eternity, and there ſhall be weeping and wailing and gnaſhing of teeth, that expreſſion is uſed three ways in Scripture.

Thirdly, of extremity or vexation, when a man cannot tell whither to turn him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.10 they ſhall gnaſh their teeth and conſume away, as for thoſe thoughts of popiſh interpreters, that there ſhall be extremity of heat, by reaſon of fire, and yet they ſhall gnaſh their teeth by reaſon of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of cold, they are but vain inventions and conceits of men igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Scripture, ſo <hi>Luke</hi> 16.23, 24. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93322:32"/>though a woman undergo extremity of pain, yet it is but bodily, and it is but ſhort, and ſhe has hope of a joyfull iſſue, becauſe a man child is born into the world, ſhe forgets her pain; but when theſe ſhall be the Travelling pains of the ſoul, which ſhall never be delivered but dye in travel, and travel for ever, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee the fruit of it, this muſt needs be perfect ſorrow.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It will appear from the cauſes of this ſorrow, and they are ſuch as that they muſt needs bring with them perfect ſorrow; Firſt, The wrath of God lets into the ſoul to the utmoſt, the curſe in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity and perfection thereof, <hi>Matth</hi> 25. <hi>Depart from me ye curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> and the Lord does it to manifeſt an attribute, to ſhew the power of his wrath. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.11.
<note place="margin">Rom 9 22</note> Now if God manifeſts his diſpleaſure here by the creature, how miſerable can he make a man? But much more when he does it immediately; for that is the fire that is here ſpoken of, the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate wrath of God upon the ſoul; and if but a few drops of it let in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93322:33"/>upon the hearts of ſome of his own people, make their ſtrength to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume away, and turn their moiſture into the drought in Summer; If when it ſeaſed upon Chriſt, the Green-tree it did come ſo fiercely, becauſe the Father was pleaſed to bruiſe him; how much more will the Lord delight to bruiſe thee? If Chriſt did ſweat drops of blood, and was in an agony under the ſence of this wrath, Oh! where muſt thy poor ſoul be, whom the Lord will hate and deal with as an enemy for ever, a veſſel of wrath.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When a man ſhall in judgment be given over to ſin per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and all the reſtraints of the ſpirit of God upon a man ſhall be taken away; there is a twofold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining grace upon mens acts, and upon their luſts, and men are in many things under both here, for their acts, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.6. I withheld thee that thou ſhouldeſt not touch her; and their luſts, when thou goeſt up to worſhip, no man ſhall deſire thy Land; but now God will let out mens luſts to their full length, and a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93322:33"/>mans thoughts ſhall be taken up with them for ever; a man ſhall feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his darling, eat the fruit of his own wayes, and be filled with his own devices. Now to be given over to be proud for ever, drunk for ever, from the cup of Gods right hand, unclean for ever, ſcoffers for ever, and <hi>that which was before a mans plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſhall now be his torment;</hi> It is but for God to change a mans appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and it will be ſo here; <hi>Amnon</hi> deſired <hi>Tamar,</hi> but after his Luſt was ſatisfied it vaniſhed, and the hatred wherewith he hated her, was more then the love with which he loved her before:
<note place="margin">1 John 2.17.</note> 
               <hi>The world paſſeth away, and the Luſt thereof,</hi> as we ſee in <hi>Judas</hi> while the Luſt of covetuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was up, there was nothing ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable as money, though it was but Thirty pieces of ſilver, but <hi>the Luſt paſſeth away,</hi> and now there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world that troubles <hi>Judas</hi> like to this, ſo that he hangs himſelf to be rid of it; and ſo it will be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, the Luſt ſhall be gone, and then for a ſoul to be given over unto it in judgment, ſhall be a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93322:34"/>torment; for as the Saints in Heaven ſhall be <hi>confirmati in bono,</hi> ſo the damned in Hell ſhall be <hi>obfirmati in malo,</hi> and that in judgment; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Aquinas</hi> has well obſerved, as in Heaven the Saints ſhall be doing good for ever, but all their good act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions <hi>pertinent ad beatitudinis praemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> ſo in Hell the wicked ſhall be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil for ever, and they can do no otherwiſe but theſe, <hi>mala pertinent ad damnationis poenam, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, The ſociety that a man ſhall be judged unto for ever, for it is part of the happineſs of the ſaints in Heaven, that they ſhall be gathered to their fathers, to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> to have their ſouls bound up in the bundle of the living,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.</note> gathered to the ſouls of juſt men made perfect; ſo for a man to be gathered to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, have their portion with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his angels, a creature that we have looked upon with the greateſt hatred here; yet then muſt be thy companions, to run out an eternity with; this is the god of this world, to him thou haſt lived here, and with him thou ſhalt live for ever.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93322:34"/>
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.5. Lead them forth with the workers of iniquity, for here men are mixed, but then he will rank them with thoſe of their own kind, and they ſhall remain in <hi>Tophet,</hi> which was a place in the valley of <hi>Ainon;</hi> a place famous for three things, there were memorable acts of mourning, there the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did cauſe their children to paſs through the fire to <hi>Molech</hi> (that is) ſacrifice their children to the Devil, there Eighteen hundred thouſand of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> camp were deſtroyed by an Angel in one night;

Becauſe they had burnt their ſons in <hi>Tophet</hi> to the Devil, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould fall and be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves in <hi>Tophet,</hi> and they ſhould bury there till there was no place; this place is put for the place of the damned, and Hell is called <hi>Tophet,</hi> the valley of ſlaughter, or the inviſible valey of <hi>Hinnon:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93322:35"/>Prov.</hi> 21.16. It is called <hi>Coetus Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantum,</hi> thoſe in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. that did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to bring the floud upon the world of the ungodly, they being the firſt noted inhabitants of Hell, therefore from them the place has its name, and all that go down ſince, are ſaid to go down into the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Giants, whom in their diſobedience and rebellion they have followed.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The very conſideration of the happineſs of the ſaints, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.28. To ſee <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> in the kingdom of God, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thruſt out; Time was that I had as fair offers, as precious op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertunities as they had, and it may be means and outward mercies far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them; but I have deſpiſed knowledg, and I would none of the fear of the Lord, I had my portion in this Life, and therefore now they are comforted, but I am tormented; I was ſo fooliſh, as to account their life madneſs, and their end to be without honour, but now they are numbred amongſt the Saints of the moſt high, and I am ſhut out. Oh
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93322:35"/>that you could call time again! This is the language of ſouls in Hell.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Here there is ſomething that may mitigate ſorrow, but all ſuch things ſhall be taken away after this life.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It's an eaſe to a mans heart here to ſpeak of his miſery, and to vent it, that he may have ſome to pity him and condole him; but there ſhall be none to pity a man then, for the law of nature ſhall ceaſe after this Life, and the devils ſhall not pity men, nor men pity one another; but rather inbitter their condition unto a man for ever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here a man in ſorrow can turn himſelf unto ſome creatures, and comfort himſelf with them, as <hi>Cain</hi> fell to building of Cities, &amp;c. But all the creatures are but for the time of this Life, and in this Life they are thy good things, but after this Life there is no ſweetneſs or uſe of any creature to eternity, for God ſhall be all in all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, But it may be ſaid ſurely God is a God of mercy, he will pity us how ever; No, thou ſhalt have judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93322:36"/>without mercy, in vengeance and recompence for ever, he will laugh at your deſtruction, and mock when your fear comes, &amp;c. And therefore conſider it: <hi>Wo to you that laugh now, for you ſhall weep,</hi> the time of your ſorrow haſtens, and when God ſhall wipe away all tears from the eyes of his people, then ſhall your ſorrow and tears begin and indure for ever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In Hell there ſhall be perfect ſhame, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. And many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the earth ſhall awake, ſome to everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, and ſome to ſhame and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting contempt; I conceive it is ſpoaken of the calling of the Jews, but in alluſion to the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome ſhall ariſe to ſhame and everlaſting contempt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.28. That we may have confidence, and not be aſhamed before him at his comeing, the ſhame of men in that day ſhall be great. For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, All a mans fooliſhneſs ſhall be laid open to himſelf, and to the view of all the world; for <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.5.11. We ſhall all be made manifeſt before the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93322:36"/>judgment ſeat of Chriſt, for it will be a day of revelation, before men and angels, friends and enemies, here men are not aſhamed becauſe their wayes are hid. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.26. The thief is not aſhamed, till he is found; but then all thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſhall be all brought to light in that day; now if men did but commonly know all that you know one by another, or much more all that a man knows by himſelf; then a man looking upon himſelf what an ugly creature he is, and how the image of God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, and the image of the Devil is upon him, how he has been taught as a beaſt, and whipt as a ſlave, when God does at firſt diſcover a man to himſelf in a mercy, by a work of conviction,
<note place="margin">Tanquam monſtrum inter filios Dei ſlo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente me ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem inſipiiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</note> How does he loath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his own ſight, ſaying that he is hell it ſelf, a beaſt and no man? And yet this is but a glimpſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he can ſee here; how much ſelf abhorrancy will it be hereafter upon a perfect diſcovery of a mans ſelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For a man to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from God with deteſtation, what a ſhame muſt this needs be?
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93322:37"/>Here every man bears up himſelf out of his ſelf-love, and the ſelf flaterie of his ſpirit, that he is as high in Gods eſteem as other men, and as much in Gods favour; but if God ſhould ſay to any man in this Congregation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you all, this man I never knew, I have ſeparated him to deſtruction, as a veſſel of wrath, whither could ſuch a man cauſe his ſhame to go? how hateful is <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> that are gone down to their own place? and how hath the Lord made their very name a reproach? ſo it will be with all ungodly men after this life, at the laſt and great day,
<note place="margin">1 Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thirdly, A man ſhall be aſhamed becauſe he ſhall be derided, and there is nothing in the world that goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93322:37"/>the nature of men more then ſhame. Firſt, by God, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.26. I will mock when your fear cometh. Secondly, the Saints. Thirdly, The Devils, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.9.12.

Fourthly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, from a mans ſpirit, <hi>Job</hi> 27.6. his heart will reproach him for his days; there is neither men nor Devils can lay ſuch bad reproaches on a man, as his own heart, and men have in ſome meaſure experience of it from day to day; And hence ſhall follow an indignation,
<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and a revenge upon a mans ſelf for ever; becauſe a man ſhall be covered with his own confuſions as with a Mantle.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There ſhall be perfect deſpair, <hi>Job</hi> 11. laſt, the hope of the wicked is breathed out, his laſt hope is gone with his laſt breath, and it muſt needs be perfect both in reſpect of good to be obtained, and evil to be avoided.</p>
            <p>Firſt, there is no hope of good to be obtained, or to have any part in the happineſs of the Saints for ever; 1. The book of Gods decrees ſhall be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93322:38"/>opened, and thoſe deeps broken up, and then a man ſhall ſee himſelf fore-ordained unto this condemnation, <hi>Jude</hi> 4.
<note place="margin">Mat. 7.23.</note> and God is not as man, that he ſhould repent: it's eaſier to weigh the fire, or meaſure the wind, and to call back yeſterday, then to call back the decree; for with God is no variableneſs nor ſhadow of change.

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, after this life a mans e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſtate is caſt, and his condition unchangeable for ever, death is but <hi>eternitatis prodromus, Luke</hi> 16. it is a gulf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.9. the time of buying is paſt: therefore the Saints ſend them to beg; for they have no oyl to ſpare, and of working, there is no work in the grave, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They ſhall try all means and avail nothing as they <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22. plead with the judge, Lord we have Propheſied in thy name, and in thy name caſt out Devils: therefore open to us &amp;c. Secondly, they ſhall mince and extenuate their ſins, and plead for themſelves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.44. Lord when ſaw we thee an hungred or a thirſt, &amp;c. Thirdly, They ſhall fall
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93322:38"/>to their prayers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.11. Lord, Lord, open unto us; but the Lord ſhall ſay, depart you workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Fourthly, They ſhall turn to the Saints,
<note place="margin">Luk. 16.24</note> father <hi>Abraham</hi> ſend <hi>Lazarus</hi> that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue. and give us of your oyl; for our Lamps are out; but there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oyl from the one, nor water from the other: and having tryed all means and nothing prevails, the ſoul ſinks into perfect deſpair for ever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is no hope of avoyding the miſerie they lye under.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There ſhall be no hope of pardon, for their ſin ſhall be ſeen in its greatneſs, and thou wilt ſay with <hi>Cain, my iniquity is greater then I can bear,</hi> then can be forgiven, thou haſt fin'd all thy life time, and to eternity thou haſt the ſame diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions; for the fire of Hell can never purge ſin, and thy obligation to the Law is eternal: and therefore the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that fell are reſerved in everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chains, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. and no mercy, but
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93322:39"/>judgment without mercy,
<note place="margin">Jam. 2.13.</note> fury with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compaſſion; for the time of mercy is paſt, and the day of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is begun, and as here mercy hath rejoyced over judgment, ſo there will be a time when judgment ſhall rejoyce over mercy for ever, and it is much eaſier to change the ſeaſons of the year, that it ſhall not be ſummer and winter in its ſeaſon, rather then the ſeaſons of the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God; for the curſe is dying, thou ſhalt dye.</p>
            <p>Secondly, No hope of mitigation or eaſe, thy honours ſhall do thee no good, it ſhall not deſcend after thee, nor thy Riches ſhall not profit in the day of wrath,
<note place="margin">Pro. 11.4.</note> there is nothing but Righteouſneſs can then avail, thou ſhalt carry nothing with thee to bribe the flames, or corrupt thy tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and not a drop of water, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. not the ſmalleſt mitigation to eternity, and this is properly the death of the ſoul, looſing the ſoul <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.26. for ſo long the ſoul will live, as long as there is hope, but hope defer'd makes the heart ſick, and hope periſhed makes the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93322:39"/>heart dye; the conſideration of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity ſwallows up a created under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to be puniſhed with eternal deſtruction, <hi>depart into everlaſting fire,</hi> this is aſtoniſhment and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful amazement, there ſhall be perfect fear; for a man ſhall receive the ſpirit of bondage perfectly, which is, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 1.7. a ſpirit of fear, we ſee it in the Devils, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.29, though they are in torment for the preſent, yet there is a time of greater torment which they expect, and that which they know they are reſerved for, and this they continually fear, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.28.
<note place="margin">Here is the Dev. is prayer.</note> I beſeech thee torment me not before the time, &amp;c. ſo <hi>Dives</hi> though in torment, yet he deſires that his brethren may not come into the ſame place, not that there is any charity in Hell; for the Devil would have all men damn'd with himſelf, and our natural affections ſhall ceaſe in Hell, but only fear of worſe to come, ſtill remains.</p>
            <p>Here in this life, ungodly men are fearleſs, and they ſeem to mock at fear, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, &amp;c. but there is a time when their fear ſhall come,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93322:40"/>
               <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.26. I will mock when their fear comes, for it will come upon them as an armed man, and the Lord will pour out upon them a tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling heart,
<note place="margin">Deu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, The terrours of God ſhall ſet themſelves in array againſt a man, <hi>Job</hi> 6.4. and we know the terrour of the Lord how dreadful it is, when he ſhall ſtir up all his wrath, and thou ſhalt pay the uttermoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and he will recover all that glory upon thee by thy ſuffering, that he has loſt by thy ſinning. Thirdly, Men may ſay, but though I know not what God can inflict, becauſe it ſhall be his wrath put forth in the power of it, though I know not what God can do, yet I know what I can ſuffer; but the Lord will ſurely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the faculties, and thou ſhalt be
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93322:40"/>in a continual terrour, that thou knoweſt not what the Lord will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large thee to ſuffer; for thou art a veſſel of wrath: and therefore 'tis ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.11. even according to thy fear, ſo is thy wrath, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Hence ſhall follow a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction and madneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.15. while I ſuffer thy terrors, I am di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, and alſo blaſphemy: I wiſh I were above God ſayes <hi>Spira,</hi> and a deſire of annihilation, wiſhing that he had never been, <hi>Job</hi> 7.14. his ſoul choſe ſtrangling rather, &amp; <hi>Judas</hi> does diſpatch himſelf to be rid of his fears, the wicked ſhall riſe to judgment, but they ſhall not be able to ſtand in judgment, ſaith <hi>Spira,</hi> this I know, and it torments me with pangs unut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable, and yet there is nothing that I deſire more than that I might come unto that place where I might know the worſt of my torment, and ſo be freed from the fear of worſe to come: Nay fear doth anticipate our evils beforehand, and thereby a man may even bring upon himſelf an eternity of torments at once, in the fear of it, the creature knows not the terror of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93322:41"/>the Lord, unleſs it be diſcover'd to him, my ſufferings are great, but my fears are endleſs, and makes a man to ſuffer even an eternity of torments at once.</p>

               </gap> adds unto this defilement, as <hi>Mark</hi> 7.20.21. And this defiles the man, there is not a vain thought in thy heart, a vain word in thy mouth, a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93322:41"/>ſinful glance of thine eye,
<note place="margin">Heb. 9.19.</note> but it adds unto thy defilement; for <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.1. It is Conſcience that receives all, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters all, all dead works lye there, this is the <hi>Tophet,</hi> or the <hi>Golgotha</hi> in the man; all the filthineſs of his life is there laid up, as in a treaſure, for wrath and vengeance, againſt the day of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the juſt judgment of God.
<note place="margin">Jer. 2.22.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is no power in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to purge the Conſcience, for thou art dead in treſpaſſes and ſins; <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. And what can be more ſutable to dead works, ſhould a man faſt, and pray, could he fill the air with ſighs, and weep even to the brim, it would add to his defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe all the works of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are dead works, and their very prayers are turned into ſin, and their ſacrifices are an abomination, and that which adds unto his defilement can never cleanſe it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If Conſcience be not purged here, it will never be purged hereafter; Here indeed there is a plaiſter that will kill this Worm, but if it out live the time of this life it is immortal it will never dye; <hi>peccatum
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93322:42"/>viatorum deleri poteſt,
<note place="margin">Aquin.</note> damnatorum non poteſt, &amp;c.</hi> The Lord will ſay I would have purged you, but you would not be purged; therefore you ſhall never be purged from your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity for ever.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, There is but one medicine in the world will do it, and if you miſs of that you will dye in your ſins, and lye down with your Conſciences full of the ſins of your youth; you may fly to prayer and preaching, and think to have it done by theſe, but it will never be, there is but one potion, and therefore it will be good for you to take that in time alſo: Now what is this medicine that will purge the Conſcience? it is the blood of Chriſt onely. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. It ſhall purge your Conſcience from dead works; and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. Having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience; Here is firſt the diſeaſe, and that is dead works, with the ſubject of it, or the part of the evil affected, that is, the Conſcience. Secondly, There is the medicine, it's the bloud of Chriſt who offered himſelf by the eternal ſpirit without ſpot to God.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93322:42"/>Thirdly, The manner how this blood doth it, it is by ſprinkling, and therein the power of this medicine is put forth.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The diſeaſe, dead works in the Conſcience are of two ſorts, Guilt and Luſt, &amp;c. But to awaken every mans Conſcience to get it purged, take theſe conſiderations. Firſt, By nature every mans Conſcience is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,
<note place="margin">Tit. 1.15. Heb. 9.14.</note> the blood of Chriſt comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no mans Conſcience, but it finds it polluted with dead works; for whether we conſider either the guilt, or the defilement of ſin, it's the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that is the main receptacle of it the guilt is laid up there: <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.1. <hi>The ſin of Judah is written with a pen of Iron, and with the point of a Diamond;</hi> it is ſpoken <hi>de ſummo &amp; indelibili reatu,</hi> it was written upon their Conſciences, and upon the horns of their Altars, <hi>nec deleri poteſt nec latere,</hi> for it did appear upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Altar, and every new act of ſin adds unto the defilement of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that's the <hi>Tophet,</hi> the <hi>Golgotha</hi> of the ſoul; men of corrupt Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are graves, though they appear
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93322:43"/>not ſo. Now when a man ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how our iniquities are gone over our heads, and are more in number then the hairs of our head, and even anſwerable to the ſand upon the Sea ſhore, innumerable; What filthy polluted Conſciences muſt ſuch men needs have.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider what a miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing it is for a man to have a polluted Conſcience;</p>
            <p>Firſt, It breaks a mans peace, the inward man is never quiet,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 57.21.</note> 
               <hi>There is no peace ſays my God to the wicked;</hi> It is as <hi>Auſtin</hi> compares it to a bad wife, that when a man hath met with hard labour abroad, trouble and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions from without, and retires himſelf, and hopes to find ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort at home, but there he has never a quiet hour; this is more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome then any of his outward croſſes can be, for it is an evil Wife that's a continual droping, ſo is Conſcience, <hi>Fugiet ab agro ad civitatem, à publico ad domum, à domo ad cubiculum, &amp; ſequitur tribulatio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It imbitters all a mans comforts, a good Conſcience will
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93322:43"/>ſweeten every croſs, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> can ſing in the ſtocks,
<note place="margin">Ubi cunque alibipaſſus eſt tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones illuc confugiet &amp; ibi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniet De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, &amp;c.</note> and the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> rejoyce a the ſtake; for whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any man ſuffers tribulation for keeping a good Conſcience thither God haſtens and finds him, and makes him rejoyce in the teſtimony of his Conſcience; ſo an evil Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will imbitter every comfort, <hi>Paul</hi> can ſtand with boldneſs at the Barr, when <hi>Felix</hi> doth tremble on the Bench; there is no ſtate can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a man that has an evil Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, his comforts will not ſecure him, they will all be imbittered, take the choyceſt pleaſures of ſin that any man of you doth injoy, it is this adds Water to your Wine, and adds a tincture of Gall and Wormwood to all your ſweetneſs and delicacies: There is an evil ſpirit that comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Saul</hi> from the Lord, and what is that, <hi>Turbatur i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i anima &amp; Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia, immoderata triſtitia a diabolo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citata,</hi> and when God did ſuffer Satan to come in and diſquiet his Conſcience, all the comforts of a kingdome could not ſweeten ſuch a mans ſpirit, neither can he
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93322:44"/>have any ſweetneſs in them all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It takes away a mans courage; a good Conſcience makes a man to be as bold as a Lyon, and he can ſet his face as a Rock, let the ſtorm come and yet the Rock ſhakes not, and he is not afraid of evil tide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but the wicked flyes when none purſues them, and indeed they need no other purſuer; for there is within them <hi>Lethalis arundo,</hi> as a Deer that is ſhot may run, but ſtill carries his miſery with him, and as <hi>Cain,</hi> ſurely every one that meets me will ſlay me. <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Herod</hi> when he heard of the fame of Jeſus, he ſays ſurely it is <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, he is riſen from the dead, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mighty works ſhew forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It unfits a man for every duty; for the guilt of it ariſing in the Conſcience ſtops a mans mouth, and ſhuts up his heart before the Lord; brings him into the preſence of God as a Malefactor into the preſence of the Judg, with a vail upon his face, and pollutes all his ſervices, his prayer is turned into ſin, for all things are
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93322:44"/>defiled unto them whoſe Conſciences are defiled. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, A man cannot promiſe himſelf any acceptance or ſucceſs in any thing he does; <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.4. He ſhall purge them as ſilver, and then ſhall their ſacrifices be pleaſant unto the Lord, &amp;c. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.13. Open thou my lips, then ſhall I teach tranſgreſſours thy way, &amp;c. God may indeed work great things by men of polluted Conſciences; but they cannot promiſe themſelves ſucceſs in any thing that they undertake till their Conſciences be purged.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Thou art in a continual fear and expectation when God will awaken it, as he ſurely will do, for ſin lyes at the dore; but between a godly man and ſin, there is a wall that will never open, but between a wicked man and ſin there is a dore, that though it may be ſhut long, it will open at laſt: and an evil Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it is that watcheth at the dore till the man dare look out, <hi>&amp; miſerrimum eſt talem habere janito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, Luther.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="72" facs="tcp:93322:45"/>
            <p>A Spirit of ſlumber upon a man, and a ſeared Conſcience is a great judgment, but it will not laſt allways, it is at fartheſt but for the time of this Life, and then the callumne upon Conſcience ſhall be worne off, and the ſlumber caſt away, and it ſhall be awakened ſo, as never to ſleep again. Read the ſtory of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Belteſhazar,</hi> of <hi>Judas,</hi> and of <hi>Spira,</hi> &amp;c. Nay, Lay your ears to Hell a while, and hear the clamours of pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Conſciences there, and you ſhall ſee that the greateſt plague that can befall a man in this life, is to be left unto the power of an evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; ſo that you had need to ſeek to have your Conſciences purged, and this is ſpecially to be conſidered of you that are grown old in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and whoſe bones are ſtill full of the ſins of your youth, having been laying in defilement into your Conſciences long, ſurely all this filth, the ſink and ſodoms of vanity that are there, cannot be eaſily purged, thoſe unclean ſtables cannot be ſoon ſwept; there is no power in nature to purge it, for we are dead in treſpaſſes and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93322:45"/>ſins, and what is more ſutable to dead men then dead works; and it is neceſſary to conſider, that if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is not purged here, it will never be purged, and there is but one means in the world will do it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider the diſeaſe, and that is a Conſcience defiled with dead works; as all the works of an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generat man are, he being a dead man, &amp;c. And Conſcience is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed onely by ſin, and there are two things in ſin that defile the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; Firſt, the guilt of it, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the defilement of it, and hence Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſay, that as a good Conſcience is either <hi>honeſte bona &amp; pacate bona,</hi> purged from the filth, purified and and pacified in reſpect of the guilt: So there is a twofold evil Conſcience, either <hi>moleſte mala,</hi> a Conſcience diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted with the guilt of ſin, or elſe <hi>vitioſe mala,</hi> polluted with the defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the filth of ſin, and a mans Conſcience muſt be purged from both theſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here is the Medicine that muſt purge the Conſcience from both theſe, and that is the blood of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93322:46"/>Chriſt; by the blood of Chriſt is meant that perfect ſatisfaction that he did give unto the juſtice of God for the ſin of man, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 2.6 A price every way anſwerable to the debt that we did owe: Now there was a double debt that man did owe to God, a debt of obedience as he was a creature, and a debt of ſervice as he was a ſinner, a debt of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the one anſwering the precept, and the other the curſe of the Law, and both are here meant by the blood of Chriſt, his whole and perfect ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, his active and paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: Onely, our whole redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is attributed to his blood. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. We have redemption through his blood, becauſe this was the laſt payment, for the debt that Chriſt did pay for us, was as a debt that men pay upon a bond by ſeveral parcels, a little at one time, and a little at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the debt is not paid, nor the bond cancelled till it be all paid; ſo though indeed all the acts of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that Chriſt did perform in our nature they were for us, and were part of that obedience that we did
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93322:46"/>owe, all the acts of obedience that he performs in the dayes of his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, takeing our nature upon him he did as our ſurety, and many of his ſufferings went before his death, for he was dying all the while; the thirty three years that he lived upon the earth, being indeed a man of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, a worm and no man, his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in his hunger and thirſt, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and wearineſs, and all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution that he ſuffered from men, after he ſet his foot upon this earth, they are to be counted as part of his ſatisfaction; but yet the ſhedding of his blood upon the Croſs, and being delivered unto death for us, this was the laſt and great act: and from the laſt payment which did fully ſatisfie the debt, and cancel the bond, hence it has its denomination; and ſo the whole ſatisfaction of Chriſt as our ſacrifice and ſurety is here meant by the blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The manner how this medicine doth work this Cure, it is by ſprinkling of it, a man muſt have his heart ſprinkled from an evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; It is a Typical expreſſion
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93322:47"/>taken from the ſacrifice under the Law, the ſacrifice muſt not onely be killed, but the bloud muſt be ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alſo; where the paſcal Lamb was to be ſlain they muſt take the blood in the Baſin, and with a branch of Hyſope ſprinkle it upon the dore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts, not that the Angel had need to have a ſignal that he might paſs over their houſes, for he knew them well enough; but they had need of it, that they might thereby have their faith tried, and ſtrengthened, in the ſprinkling of that blood, of which the blood of the Lamb was but a Type: So <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.8. When they had offered the ſacrifice, <hi>Moſes</hi> took the blood and ſprinkled it upon all the people,
<note place="margin">Lev. 14.14.</note> and when the Leaper was cleanſed, he came to the door of the Tabernacle and brought a treſpaſs offering, and the Prieſt did take of the blood, and put it upon his right ear, and the thumb of his right hand: And in anſwer to all this Type, the blood of Chriſt is called the blood of ſprinkling. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. And this ſprinkling is nothing elſe but the application of his merit, and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93322:47"/>of this blood, unto a mans own particular ſoul, for in Chriſt's ſacrifice there was a ſatisfaction and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the one is in killing the ſacrifice, and the other in ſprinkling the blood; and this is done when by a mighty work of the Holy Ghoſt, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience affected, and afrighted with the guilt of ſin, doth rely and caſt it ſelf upon this ſatisfaction, to be a ſacrifice for him, then is this ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction apropriated, and applied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; ſo this blood as ſprinkled is a ſpeaking blood, it ſpeaks better things then the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> (that is) it ſpeaks ſo in the Conſcience, <hi>non vindictam clamat ſed veniam;</hi> Conſcience is pacified, and a man thereby puts his ſins upon the head of the Beaſt: Our ſacrifice is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſatisfaction, and the Conſcience is not terrified with the guilt of ſin, as if it were his own, and as if he were to ſatisfie in his own perſon no more; for the ſoul ſaith he was made ſin for us, that knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him: <hi>Chriſt came into the World to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chief.</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:93322:48"/>And here are theſe ſix things taken in by the ſoul, to pacifie the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in reſpect of guilt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, When the ſoul ſees by a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and heavenly teaching, that the great plot and deſign of God under the ſecond Covenant, is to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſin; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.4. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, To take ſin off the ſinner; for if God will be juſt he muſt puniſh the ſin, and if he be mercifull in ſparing the ſinner, there muſt be a way to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the ſin from the ſinner; and this the Lord will do by an act of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, ſuch as he did never exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe unto perſons under the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and that is by imputing of our ſin unto another, who was right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.20.21.</note> and he was made ſin for us, who knew no ſin; he will be juſt, and therefore there ſhall not be <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutatio juſtitiae,</hi> and he will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, and therefore there muſt be <hi>à commutatio perſonae,</hi> there had been elſe no place for mercy to have come, onely there is this one cauſe, the Lord will change the perſon, and by an act of abſolute ſovereignty, the Lord will count it ſo, that the ſin
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93322:48"/>ſhall be in Gods account in the guilt of it taken off from the one, <hi>in foro divino</hi> and put upon another.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When the ſoul ſees to this end God did call his ſon Chriſt, and did appoint him to be a publick perſon, and a repreſentative head, and our ſurety; for theſe two are very different conſiderations; Firſt, a ſurety is one that enters into bond, and engages himſelf for the dept of another, and ſo Chriſt is become our ſurety: therefore he was bound by our bond, and engageth himſelf for the dept of another, for our dept he was made under the Law, and ſo as a ſacrifice he ſtood in the ſtead of a ſinner, and the ſacrifice was to be offered for the man; and ſo ſome expound that place,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.21. Iſa. 53.</note> he was made ſin for us, that is, a ſin-offering: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth take our ſins upon him as his own, and ſo doth confeſs them unto God, <hi>my iniquities have taken hold upon, Pſal.</hi> 40.12. and ſo the Lord doth impute them and lay them upon him as his own; for <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6. he did make to meet upon him the iniquities of us all, and the word
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93322:49"/>doth ſignify hoſtile, <hi>congreſſu,</hi> they met with all their violence upon him, and therefore he was made ſin for us, that is, as a ſurety in our ſtead, he bears our ſins in his body, upon he tree, he was delivered for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt is a common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a repreſentative head, one that repreſents another mans perſon, and acts the part of another, according to the appointment of the Law, the acceptation of the judge, that what is done by him, the perſon is ſaid to do; whoſe perſon he doth repreſent; and ſo was <hi>Adam</hi> a common perſon, and that by an act of Gods Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, appointing him in making a covenant with him ſo to be, and he did repreſent all man-kind, and hence it comes to paſs, that his ſin is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto us, and made ours; ſo in our Law, an Atturney appears in the behalf of his Client, and ſo Chriſt is ſaid to be gone to Heaven as our Atturney <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to appear before God for us;
<note place="margin">Heb 9.24.</note> ſo in paying a dept, or taking poſſeſſion, livery and ſeizin by an Atturney, it's all one as if done
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93322:49"/>by the perſon himſelf, who is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and is as valed; ſo Kings are repreſented in their Ambaſſadors, and what is done unto them, or by them, is counted the act of the Prince; if they make peace the King makes peace, and if they denounce war, the King doth it, if an injury be offered to them, as to <hi>Davids</hi> Ambaſſadors, it is done to the Prince; becauſe they do repreſent his perſon; ſo the Lord Chriſt is a common perſon by an act of Gods ſoveraignty, repreſenting the perſon of all the elect of God, being appointed by God to be a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> and as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> did repreſent all in him, ſo the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> does repreſent all in him alſo: a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d therefore as judgment came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs comes upon all in the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo then ſayes the ſoul, he is my ſurety: and therefore is bound to pay my debt, and he is a common perſon, as in my ſtead: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſatisfaction that is made unto God by him is in Law to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mine as really as if my Atturney ſhould pay a debt for me, I ſhould
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93322:50"/>reſt ſatisfied that the debt is paid, and in Law ſhall never be exacted of me, though it was not paid by my ſelf in perſon, but by another, who did perſonate me in that act, and did it for me and in my behalf.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This is a ſpecial ſervice that God the father call'd him unto, and for it he did promiſe him a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; ſo that the plot of all is not Chriſts, but it is originally God the fathers, that he might make way for his mercy in pardoning ſin: and therefore Chriſt doth it as God the fathers ſervant, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. and in it he doth the fathers buſineſs, and he comes to do the fathers will in it, and not his own will, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7. and it is this will that is the ground of all the acceptation of all that Chriſt has done in our behalf, by which Will we are ſanctified; for if Chriſt had ſatisfied the juſtice of God, yet it was free with God to accept it or not, he might have choſe, and it's an act of grace, and yet of ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he will grant a ſurety, and a commutation of the perſon: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's ſaid,
<note place="margin">Joh 10.18</note> he did it by the fathers
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93322:50"/>commandment,
<note place="margin">Joh. 17.2.</note> I have finiſhed the work thou gaveſt me to do, and the Lord gives him a reward for it, he gives him a name above every name,
<note place="margin">Phil. 2.9.</note> and an inheritance, he ſits down at the right hand of the Majeſty on high, Angels, Principalities and Powers being made ſubject to him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This Chriſt undertook freely and readily, it was a thing that he could not have been compelled unto; for he was in the forme of God, &amp; thought it no rohbery to be equal, with God, yet he came readily for the glory of his Father,
<note place="margin">Pro. 8 30.</note> and he was his delight before the world was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was an inhabitant; and <hi>Pſal</hi> 40. <hi>I delight to do thy Will, thy Law was within my bones,</hi> the Law of laying down his life as a ſurety, is in the middle of my bowels, the deareſt and tendereſt affections Chriſt had for it, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.56. I have a baptiſm, and I am pained till it be ended, he ſpeaks it of his ſacrifice, and though to ſhew what a great miſery it was in it ſelf, he manifeſted an averſneſs to it, <hi>voluntate naturae,</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:93322:51"/>yet as it was his Fathers will for our ſalvation, he cheerfully imbraced it, and drank off that bitter cup to the bottom, <hi>voluntate officii;</hi> therefore Chriſt became our ſurety, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative head for us, freely he did ſtrike hands with the Lord of his own accord willingly, and without regreet, he gave the hand to the Lord.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,
<note place="margin">Iſa 5.3.10.</note> The debt he hath payed, the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him,
<note place="margin">Num. 11.8.</note> for it pleaſed the father to bruiſe him; the word ſignifies <hi>conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere</hi> to break him to pieces as in a Morter, and he made his grave with the wicked; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.10. <hi>In that he died, he died unto ſin once:</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9 28. And he was offered to bear the ſins of many, &amp;c. And in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony thereof he was taken from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and from judgment, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.3. His Priſon was the grave, and by judgment and condemnation paſſed upon him by God himſelf, and after ſatisfaction given, the Lord ſent an Angel and rowled away the ſtone from the grave; the debt being ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the Lord doth ſend an Officer
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93322:51"/>to releaſe his perſon, for it was not to ſupply any defect of power in Chriſt that an Angel came; for he that could raiſe up himſelf from death, and thereby declare himſelf the Son of God with power, he that could looſe the pains of death, he could rowl a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſtone from the grave, but it was done in a legal and judiciary way; and therefore he is ſaid to be juſtified: <hi>He is near that juſtifies me,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> Iſa.</hi> 50.8. And by this he doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the World of righteouſneſs, becauſe the Lord delivered him from death. Becauſe he doth go to the Father.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, For a Soul by an Almighty power of God to reſt upon this ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his, and to plead it before God for himſelf, at his judgment ſeat.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To look upon Chriſt as dying not for himſelf, but as a ſurety; for in juſtification and the purging of Conſcience from the guilt of ſin, the eye of Faith is mainly ſet upon Chriſt crucified, Chriſt as dying, and that as a ſurety, to make ſatisfaction:
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.2. Heb 9.22.</note> I deſire to know nothing but Chriſt,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93322:52"/>and Chriſt crucyfied, for without ſheding of blood there is no remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For though it is true, that the perſonal excellencies that be in Chriſt, are the objects of Faith; yet that Faith as it comes to Chriſt in the act of juſtyfication, and being quit of the guilt of ſin, it mainly looks upon Chriſt dying, Chriſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To look upon Chriſt as a repreſentative head, as one in whom I died as a ſurety, ſo as one in whome I roſe, he was juſtyfied and I in him, becauſe as he dyed for me, ſo for me he was juſtified alſo, and Chriſt was formerly condemned, therefore there muſt an act of aquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſs upon Chriſt, and therefore <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. That it was ſo apeared plainly, for he did bear the ſins of many in reſpect of the guilt of them, and he ſhall apear the ſecond time without ſin, that is, have the guilt of no ſin charged upon him in opoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto his former bearing our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, he ſhall be aquitted before men and angels, and therefore he roſe as the firſt fruits, as a perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93322:52"/>all the reſt of the elect, and he was juſtified in the ſpirit, that is, raiſed up by the power of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, thereby he was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to be juſtified, and as he is ſanctified as a common perſon, and receives an Image for us, that we muſt bear the Image of the heavenly there, is life eternal laid up in him, ſo he is juſtified as a common perſon from the guilt of ſin, that not any iniquity remains unſatisfied for in his behalf, that is, the ranſom in his death is fully paid, and as we were condemned in <hi>Adam</hi> a common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; ſo it is reaſon we ſhould be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by Chriſt as in a common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alſo: now when a ſoul by an almighty work of the ſpirit of God looks upon all theſe acts of Chriſt, and the ſoul reſts upon them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the guilt of ſin, he doth put his ſins upon the head of his ſurety, and looks upon himſelf as acquitted in his juſtification and caſts himſelf upon it that he may attain it: thus the blood of Chriſt is ſaid by a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty work of the ſpirit on Chriſts part, and faith on ours, to be ſprinkled
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93322:53"/>upon our Conſciences, to purge them from the guilt of dead works.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But how ſhall I know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be ſuch an almighty power put forth in me, that I may ſtay my ſoul upon Chriſts blood thus ſatisfying, that I might be able thereby to ſee my Conſcience purged, and pacified, and the terrour of ſin taken away?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> A man ſhall know this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty work of the ſpirit, ſprinkling this blood of Chriſt upon the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by enabling a man unto that which all the power and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a natural Conſcience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perform, and it will be ſeen in three things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, When a mans Conſcience awakened and convinced of ſin, doth yet make after reconciliation with God, and union with Chriſt; for a natural Conſcience can find it eaſie to believe while he goes on ſtill in his ſins, and Conſcience is a ſleep, and indeed the faith of moſt men is but a good conceit of themſelves, from the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93322:53"/>ſelf flatery of their own hearts; but as ſoon as Conſcience is awakened, by and by they fly from God and look upon him as an enemy, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.5. there are Mountains to be made a plain, and there are Valleys to be fill'd: now when a ſoul conſiders himſelf under the condemnation of ſin, the curſe of the Law, and looks upon God as an angry judge, and yet ſaith, I have heard that the Lord of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is a mercifull God; and if mercy ſave me I ſhall be ſaved, and if mercy deſtroy me I ſhall but dye, I will fly to him whom I have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and lye down at his footſtool; there is nothing in the world that I deſire like unto reconciliation with him, and I would be reconciled to him in his own way, the way of union with Chriſt, I would he found in him, not having my own righteouſneſs, I would ſubmit to the way of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: <hi>Oh, bleſſed is the Man unto whom the Lord imputes this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> and he is made the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God in Chriſt, when a ſoul thus convinced of ſin, ſaith, <hi>God be mercifull to me a ſinner:</hi> I will
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93322:54"/>now go to him, and leave my ſelf with him, let him do as it ſeemeth good to him, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, if the Lord delight in me, he will ſave me, &amp;c. truly all the power of nature improved, can never make men leave themſelves with God in this manner.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When a mans ſins are diſcovered, and the Lord leads a man into the wardrope of Chriſts righteouſneſs, and enables him to ſee how there is enough therein to cover them all, and as God ſaw enough of Chriſts righteouſneſs to ſatisfie him in point of juſtice; ſo the Lord doth by a glorious light ſhew unto the ſoul enough of Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſatisfy alſo in point of guilt, that the ſoul can in ſome meaſure in Chriſt anſwer all the objections that Conſcience can make by ſome ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual reaſonings drawn from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as when Conſcience objects, ſin is a tranſgreſſion of the Law; but the ſoul anſwers, the ſufferings of Chriſt are the humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Law-giver, ſin is a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God in point of goods; but Chriſt that made all things with
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93322:54"/>him, and had the ſame title unto all that God the Father had, he laid down all, and became poor, and took a new title unto all, he had more then a world to lay down, ſin did wrong God in point of honour, but he that was the brightneſs of his glory did abaſe himſelf, and made himſelf of no reputation, and did bring thereby more honour to God, he being ſubject to him, then the ſubjection of all the creatures could have done; it was a higher honour to the Soveraignty of God to have his ſon a ſervant, then could have been to have had the ſervice of all the creatures, and he can do him more ſervice, and bring him in more glory in an hour, then all the creatures could have done if man had ſtood to eternity; ſin did offend God, but Chriſts righteouſneſs did pleaſe him, in him his ſoul delights, and is well pleaſed ſin blotted out Gods Image in man, Chriſt reſtored it again, we were full of all unrighteouſneſs, and he fulfilled all righteouſneſs; my ſins are all hainous, but greater were charged upon Chriſt; he was a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93322:55"/>as a Traytor, a blaſphemer, a Drunkard, a Seducer, a Conjurer, a Devil, he was made ſin for us, he made his grave with the wicked, and thy heart was very wicked, and full of enmity when thou didſt commit ſin; but Chriſts heart was holy, and full of love to God when he ſatisfied for it, thou didſt delight in ſin, and ſo did Chriſt delight to ſuffer, he was payned till his ſufferings were ended, thou didſt ſin openly at ſuch a time, and ſuch a place, &amp;c. The Lord ſuffered without the gate open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the view of all, and as thy ſin is the greateſt ſin, ſo is his moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſuffering in the moſt ſolemn time, as it were before all the world, and in a moſt infamous place, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt malefactor as it were at <hi>Tyburne;</hi> and for the company he ſuffered in it was between two Theeves, &amp;c. when a ſoul is able to ſilence the guilt and clamour of his Conſcience by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering all that Conſcience can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, by finding out ſomething in the righteouſneſs and ſatisfaction of Chriſt to anſwer it, and faith is not nonpluſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, truly this is a work of an almighty
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93322:55"/>power; for while men go on in the pleaſures of ſin, ſo long ſin is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſin ſits with no weight upon them; but when their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is awakened to it, by and by their ſpirits are overwhelmed with it, as <hi>Judas</hi> was; now for a man to ſee ſin in its utmoſt dimenſions, and not to ſpare and be ſtreightned in his humiliation, and yet when Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has ſaid its worſt, yet for him to be able to look into Chriſt, and ſee ſomething in him that ſhall anſwer all its accuſations, with as great ſtrength of ſpiritual reaſon as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be objected, and for a mans ſoul to be ſtay'd by ſuch thoughts, when he is even going down to the pit, this is an almighty power.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When a man is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of ſin and ſees himſelf to be an undone man, knows not whether God will be mercifull unto him or no; he walks in darkneſs in point of juſtification, and yet his heart is kept in a conſtant awe of ſinning againſt God, he would do nothing that ſhould diſpleaſe him for a world, his darling luſt doth yield and ſtrike ſail to the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93322:56"/>contrary grace,
<note place="margin">Sam. 50.10.11.</note> he fears the Lord and obeys the voice of his ſervant, he would do nothing that ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him for a world, and yet he knows not whether he ſhall find mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with him or no, but his ſoul takes up an unchangeable reſolution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, and ſayes, I will walk no more in a way of ſinning, ſaved or damned, I will be willing to obey him and count it my happineſs to do him ſervice, and I will be willing to wait upon him, let him do with me as it ſeems good in his ſight; if caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mans ſelf upon Chriſt make a man fear to ſin againſt him, there is an almighty power <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that all the power of a natural Conſcience will never make the man to yield up his darling-luſt, as there is a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <hi>moleſte mala</hi> full of perplexity in reſpect of guilt, and the purging of the Conſcience therein lies in its pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification, when a man looking upon ſin in its greatneſs and exceeding ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and yet can ſee <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, unto which as a City of refuge he flyes, being purſued, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. and upon that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93322:56"/>he caſts himſelf and pleads it before the judgment ſeat of God, that the debt is paid, and the ſurety acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and this he doth either by an act of recombancy and reliance, or elſe by an act of aſſurance, as the Lord is pleaſed to clear his intereſt, and ſo the man is for ever perfected according to his Conſcience, that is,
<note place="margin">Heb. 9.6</note> though ſin doth cleave to him, and the guilt of ſin may by Satan be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him, yet conſcience flying unto Chriſt for a refuge, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him a perfect ſatisfaction, the man caſts all upon his ſurety, and his Conſcience is calm and ſerene, as a man himſelf indebted muſt needs be, when he knows that his ſurety hath paid his debt, and though there be a dayly application of this unto the ſoul, yet there is but one obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the man upon this ground hath no more Conſcience of ſin, in reſpect of the guilt of it for ever, and this pacification of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is the perfection of the man, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But there is a Conſcience alſo that is <hi>vitioſe mala,</hi> full of the defilement
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93322:57"/>and pollution of ſin, 1 <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. All evil is put under too heads, <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum triſte,</hi> afflicting evil, or <hi>malum turpe,</hi> defiling evil; and ſin has in it both theſe, as it binds a man over unto all afflicting evil, ſo there is a guilt; and as it doth fill a man with all polluting evil, ſo there is a defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>a macula,</hi> a ſtain, and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin, and it hath all the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the World in it, it is leproſy, pollution in blood, a ſepulcher, and the rottenneſs thereof, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the very excrement of wickedneſs,
<note place="margin">Jam. 1.21.</note> that if there could be any thing more filthineſs then naughtineſs it ſelf it is ſin, it has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced the image of God, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive beauty of the ſoul, and it hath brought upon a man poſitive filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even the image of the Devil, and the dreadful marks of helliſh deformity, that cannot be waſhed away with Niter and much Sope <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.1.</p>
            <p>Though this be an univerſal pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution that overſpreads the whole man, defiles body and ſoul, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yet the main defilement of ſin
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93322:57"/>lyes in the Conſcience; and where every ſin doth add to the pollution, as every act intends the habit, above all the faculties, the defilement of the Conſcience is increaſed thereby: Now, the great pollution of the ſoul lyes in a ſpirit of ſlumber, Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence letting a man commit evil and not to tell him it is evil, and in his ſenceleſneſs under ſin; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.10. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.19. Being bribed by Luſt, and paſſions, and pleaſures, to give conſent to a ſin, and to plead for it; for Conſcience to paſs ſentence for a ſin, and that in the name of God,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 16.2</note> and ſay that it is a duty, and ſtirs up a man to it, which it may be is one of the greateſt ſins of his Life, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience pleads for ſin and excuſes a man, falſly ſpeaking peace to a man in a corrupt and curſed ſtate, ſaying, I ſhall have peace though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenneſs to thirſt, &amp;c. In a reprobate ſenſe, to be in ſuch a mind that Conſcience approves things that are evil, and the falſe reaſonings of ſin in the Conſcience, the man cannot ſee, men are given over to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93322:58"/>believe the lyes of their own ſpirits, and cannot ſay is there not a lye in my right hand; and a ſeared Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with a hot Iron, that man deſpiſes the threatning and judgment of God,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.9.</note> and is wholly inſenſible as ſeared fleſh: And all this defilement is not brought into the Conſcience from without, but grows out of it by cuſtome in ſinning. And the ground of it is, becauſe Conſcience is the higheſt faculty and has the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt office in the man, and therefore it is by corruption of the Conſcience that all the reſt of the faculties are ſo exceedingly corrupted as they are, becauſe Conſcience doth not its duty, and therefore God will mainly lay load upon the Conſcience after this life, as this had the main hand in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing the man, ſo it ſhall be the great inſtrument in tormenting the man; for could men walk on in ſin as they do, if Conſcience did its duty, if it did inſtruct, ſuggeſt, accuſe truly, as in the name of God, and never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe but upon grounds from the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that God gives of things, &amp;c. The great pollution of the whole ſoul
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93322:58"/>flows from the pollution of the Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcience, and therefore when the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> do crowd down the defilement of the ſoul unto the inferiour facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the affections and paſſions, as if they were the ſink of the ſoul, and all the filthineſs were ſwept down upon them, but as for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding &amp; the will, they are in a great meaſure free, the Miſtreſs or Lady in the ſoul; and if a light be brought into the underſtanding, the will has a power to follow, and ſo ſay the <hi>Arminians</hi> alſo, and it is a doctrine that ſpreads much amongſt us; ſo when you hear Divines ſay that of all the faculties the Conſcience is the leaſt polluted, take heed of it, for the main filthineſs of thy ſoul lyes there. And the reaſon that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly given, is becauſe Conſcience in the worſt men doth many times take part with God againſt ſin, when Luſt carries a man and his will is very violently bent upon it; but conſider in an unregenerate man, this doth not proceed from the purity of his Conſcience, even at that time when it doth take part with God, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93322:59"/>there is the ſpirit of God comes in and ſtirs up Conſcience, and lays a command upon it, and forceth it to do its duty, which it would be glad to let alone, and let Luſt revel in it without controle, it would ſurely gratify the affection it has to Luſt; but that the ſpirit of God comes in and over-aws the Conſcience, and doth awaken and terrify it, and force it to ſpeak, and therefore it doth not any more argue the purity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, then <hi>Balaams</hi> bleſſing of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſs, did argue his love to <hi>Iſrael</hi> whom he did earneſtly deſire to have curſed, and did greedily follow after the way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of unrighteouſneſs, but that the Lord held a ſtrickt hand upon his Convcience that he durſt not ſin in it being over-awd; but it was no thanks to <hi>Balaam:</hi> And ſo it is here, no thanks to Conſcience which is corrupt and will by degrees grow inſencible, and incourage a man deſperately in a way of ſinning, even to deſpight of the ſpirit of Gods grace.</p>
            <p>Now, How ſhall this defilement be purged, all theſe dead works how
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93322:59"/>ſhall they be cleanſed? It is by the blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, From the Holyneſs of his nature as he is our Head; For by the blood of Chriſt, is meant all his active and paſſive obedience, and in his active obedience, the holyneſs of his nature muſt be taken in, as he was man he received the ſpirit; He had a union and an unction from the free grace of the Father, calling him to this great work, and by a glorious ſovereignty appointed Chriſt to be the head of his Church, and the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> to ſtand in their ſtead to perform all for them, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all for them; &amp;c. So he did receive the ſpirit as an unction from the Father, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. I will put my ſpirit upon him, he ſhall be cloathed with the Holy Ghoſt, and put it on as a garment, and this ſpirit he doth receive as a head, that he may diſperſe it; for the infinite holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Divine nature could no more be communicated, then the infinite righteouſneſs of the Divine nature could be imputed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt perform perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93322:60"/>in his humane nature for our juſtification, that it may be imputed to us, and he muſt receive perfect holineſs in his humane nature for our ſanctification, that it may be impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us, <hi>John.</hi> 17.19. For their ſakes I ſanctify my ſelf, that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved a ſpirit of ſanctification, that it might be unto them a principle of holineſs, and the fountain of their ſanctification alſo, which I conceive to be meant by the Law of the ſpirit of life that is in Chriſt Jeſus has made me free from the law of ſin and death;
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.2.</note> What is the Law of ſin and death? It is the power of ſin to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, defiling, and deſtroying, and what is the Law of the ſpirit of Life? it is put for the powerful and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding work of the living, and the quickning ſpirit of Chriſt; and this Law, not as it is in us, but as it is in Chriſt, it is this that frees us both in reſpect of juſtification and of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication alſo, from the law of ſin to defile, and rule, and alſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn and to deſtroy, and thus from the holineſs of the nature of Chriſt it comes to paſs, that the ſame ſpirit
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93322:60"/>that was in him is conveyed unto us, his union did abundantly ſanctifie him in himſelf, it being perſoual, and therefore there was an inpecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, the <hi>actus eſt ſuppoſiti,</hi> but his unction was for us, he had a fulneſs of the ſpirit, as he was our ſurety, he paid our debt, and as our head, ſo he received a ſpirit for us, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced it to us, &amp;c. thus you ſee the ſanctification of the humane nature of Chriſt doth purge a mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeience from dead works, even the Law of the ſpirit of life that is in Chriſt Jeſus, makes us free from the Law of ſin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is in the blood of Chriſt <hi>a cauſa meritoria,</hi> and it doth meritoriouſly purge the Couſcience; for though there was the fulneſs of all grace in the humane nature of Chriſt, yet it could never have been conveyed unto us without a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction had gone before, God muſt be ſatisfied that men might be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified; for there is in the ſufferings of Chriſt two things. Firſt, The payment of a debt. Secondly, There is a redundancy of merit, ſome thing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93322:61"/>muſt be procured for man, <hi>non ſolum inſtauratus eſt,
<note place="margin">Auſt.</note> ſed &amp; melioratus; à peccatis ablutus, inſtauratus eſt, in caeteris melioratus.</hi> Auſt. Tom. 4.9. 123. p. 613.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It doth purchaſe the perſons of the elect:
<note place="margin">Acts 20.28.</note> therefore they are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a purchaſed people, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.14. they are the ſeed that do ariſe from the travel of his ſoul; for he dyed as a grain, that he might not abide alone, <hi>John</hi> 12.32. when the Son of man is lifted up he will draw all men unto him, and the ſelecting of the Saints out of this world, is a fruit of his death, and a part of the purchaſe thereof, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All the graces and all the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt are part of his purchaſe, though in him they were free, he did not merit his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction no more then his union, the humane nature could not merit it, yet as they are beſtowed upon us, ſo they are the fruit of his merit; for they could never have conveyed this unto us, if he had not ſatisfied God, and laid down a price anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93322:61"/>unto all, and therefore, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.9, 10. he that aſcended is the ſame that deſcended into the lower parts of the Earth, and he aſcended that he might fill all things, all the fruit of his aſcention comes from his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, had he never deſcended he had never aſcended: therefore all the fulneſs of the graces and the gifts that the elect have it, is grounded upon this; the fruit of all his offices is grounded upon his Prieſt-hood, he does as a Prophet teach, but that he had never done, if he had not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, he doth as a King diſpence gifts, but theſe gifts he gives to his people by his prieſthood, as an honour that the Lord has given him becauſe of his abaſement, and his humiliation, and thus our ſanctification and the purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Conſcience flows from the death of Chriſt, which is the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cauſe thereof.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The active obedience of Chriſt is the pattern and the <hi>cauſa exemplaris</hi> of all that holineſs and purification that is required of us, our holineſs conſiſting in a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity into Chriſt, he having received
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93322:62"/>the Image of God in himſelf, and by beholding of his Image we are chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the ſame, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 7. laſt verſe, Chriſts life is a living Scripture, a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible commentary upon the Law of God, whoſe actions we muſt follow, be you followers of me as I am of Chriſt; looking to Jeſus, and ſeting him before us,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.21</note> as <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> a Copy for us to write after, and whoſe virtues we muſt ſhew forth, our happineſs being to be like him in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. we muſt reſemble him here as a child doth his father; for as we have born the Image of the earthly, ſo we muſt bear the Image of the heavenly, as we have born the one here in ſin and guilt, ſo we muſt bear the other here in grace, and hereafter in glory.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Chriſts blood doth cleanſe us by the precepts and the promiſes of the Goſpel, he doth ſanctifie us by his truth.
<note place="margin">John 17.</note> Firſt, by the precepts of it; for he ſaith, be you holy as I am holy, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, as obedient children: faſhion not your ſelves according to the luſts of your
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93322:62"/>former ignorance, put off the old man and put ye on the new man, be not conformable to the World, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, and all theſe precepts have a purging vertue, becauſe <hi>through the blood of Chriſt all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Goſpel carry grace with them, and a ſpirit</hi> that inables men to fullfil the command, <hi>jubet &amp; ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed you may well queſtion, can a thing that is intrinſically unclean purge it ſelf, can a Black-moor change his skin? &amp;c. It is true he cannot, but there is a creating word <hi>verbum factivum,</hi> ſuch as Chriſt ſaid unto the Leper, I will, be thou clean and by his commanding it, the ſoul is cleanſed, as when God by a way of command did cauſe the creatures to to ſtand up act of nothing, for the commands of the Goſpel they are as ſeed by which a man is begotten, and they are as a mold into which a man is transformed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. A man is caſt into it, as into a frame, that doth change him, and <hi>fides impetrat qu od lex
<note n="*" place="margin">Auſt.</note> imperat.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="108" facs="tcp:93322:63"/>
            <p>Secondly, In the promiſes of the Goſpel, and they are all grounded in the blood of Chriſt, for all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are in him, yea, and in him Amen; he is the center, and they are all as ſo many lines drawn from him, he is the great promiſe that gives being unto all the reſt of the promiſes and efficacy; it's the death of the Teſtatour that doth confirme the Teſtament, it were elſe a blank; and therefore the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is called the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his blood. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28. That is the whole New Teſtament and the promiſes thereof are offered and ſealed unto you in his blood, and <hi>if it were not a Teſtament in his blood, it were invalid and of none effect,</hi> and the promiſes of the Goſpel do purge the Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As they are objects of Faith, Chriſt having promiſed in them a purification, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Zac.</hi> 13.1. There is a fountain open for ſin and for uncleanneſs;
<note place="margin">Iſa. 52.15.</note> it is <hi>aſperſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> doctrinae &amp; juſtitiae. Mal.</hi> 3.1. He ſhall ſit as a refiner and ſhall ſanctify the ſons of <hi>Levi</hi> with refiners fire;

<note place="margin">Exek. 36.25.37.</note> I will ſprinkle clean water upon them, &amp;c. They ſhall not defile themſelves any more with their Idols, and with their deteſtable things. Now the ſoul looking upon the faithfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and his goodneſs ingaged in theſe, ſayeth, having theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs, both of fleſh and ſpirit, and <hi>theſe promiſes Faith turns into prayer,</hi> and obtains the mercy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, becauſe all theſe promiſes are confirmed by the bloud of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The promiſes do purge the Conſcience as they are grounds of hope, for they are onely promiſes that are the grounds of hope to the ſaints,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.49.</note> 
               <hi>eſtabliſh thy word unto thy ſervant upon which thou haſt cauſed me to hope, and a hope that is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a promiſe, is a hope that will never make a man aſhamed,</hi> and hope is a great ground of purging, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12.13. Looking for that bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c. who gave himſelf for us that he might redeem us from all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93322:64"/>and purify to himſelf a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people. &amp;c. The grace of God bringing ſalvation, teacheth us that denying ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts, &amp;c. Looking for the bleſſed hope and the glorious appearing of God, as many as have this hope do purify themſelves even as he is pure, &amp;c. Truly in all things <hi>the more lively a mans hopes are, the more ſpringing his endeavours are:</hi> And he doth take care to caſt away that which will cloud his hope, or defer it;
<note place="margin">Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l. 3.12.</note> I have a hope of the prize of the high calling, and it is ſome ground that I have got already, ſomething that I have attain'd, but yet it is but a little; but upon a hope that I ſhall have him that indeed is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> in my eye, therefore I ſtrive with all my might, and preſs hard to the mark &amp;c. And thus the blood of Chriſt gives an efficacy unto all the precepts and the promiſes of the Goſpel, and they are all of them by this means of a cleanſing nature, they do purge the Conſcience, they have all a cleanſing property.</p>
            <pb n="111" facs="tcp:93322:64"/>
            <p>Fifthly, The blood of Chriſt doth purge the Conſcience, by ſprinkling all means that it ſhall tend unto a mans purification; that as by ſin all things do become means to defile the Conſcience, <hi>ſo by the blood of Chriſt all things ſhall become means to purge the Conſcience; Tit.</hi> 1.15. Unto the pure all things are pure, but unto them that are defiled, and unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is nothing pure, but even their mind and Conſcience is defiled: For under the law the ſprinkling of the blood was not onely upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but upon the book, and the tabernacle and all the veſſels of the miniſtery, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.19 Implying that none of theſe would have been inſtruments of purging of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, if they had not themſelves been firſt purged by the blood of Chriſt: But what are the means that thus purge the Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The word of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.26. That he might ſanctify and cleanſe it with the waſhing of Water, by the word; and <hi>John</hi> 15.3. <hi>Now ye are clean through the word which I have ſpoken unto you. &amp;c.</hi> Mens
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93322:65"/>Conſciences are purged by it, but yet in it ſelf it will increaſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement, as unto all unregenerate men it does; <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.7. <hi>The ground that drinks in the rain that comes oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dreſſed, receiveth bleſſing from God: But that which bears thorns, and briers, is rejected and is nigh to curſing.</hi> And yet if Chriſt ſprinkle it with his blood, it will ſurely purge the Conſcience, and all the purging vertue that the word has, is becauſe his blood was ſprinkled with the blood of the ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All other ordinances al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo;
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3 3.</note> Firſt, that of the miniſtery, ye are our epiſtle, and though ye have Ten thouſand inſtructers, yet not many Fathers, but I have begotten you through the Goſpel: Now even this ordinance that was appointed for their cleanſing will but increaſe their pollution of themſelves, if their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed heart ſhould riſe againſt the meſſage they bring them, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the blood of Chriſt, and then God in judgment ſays to his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters go make the heart of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93322:65"/>fat, let their hearts be hardened and their ſpirits riſe againſt it, that hearing they may hear, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, leaſt they be converted and I ſhould heal them; the Luſts of men are thereby the more exaſperated and drawn forth, as it did in the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> under Chriſts miniſtery, their enmity did riſe to the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, beſides Blaſphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſon of man, but that the miniſtery is effectual to any ſouls, it is onely the ſprinkling of the blood of Chriſt upon all the ordinances thereof, and it will purge if Chriſt in it ſit as a refiner of ſilver in his ſhop, and do concurr in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to their refinement.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The example of the Saints are a means of purging the Conſcience; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.17. Be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers together of me, and mark them which walk ſo as ye have us for an enſample, &amp;c. When a man doth obſerve unto what a pitch of holineſs and purification the Saints of God have attained, as the example of Chriſt ſo of the ſaints alſo, ſuch preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing forward to more ſpirituality,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93322:66"/>ſuch growth in grace and in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, ſuch love to all Saints, this is a great means to raiſe the hearts of them that fear God, to give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to be as they were, holy in all manner of converſation: But yet they will be a means of pollution of themſelves, even theſe glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Chriſt and his followers, if not ſprinkled with the blood of Chriſt; and as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> looking upon the holyneſs of the Saints, they were the more inraged; ſo the more lively men do ſee holyneſs, in the practiſe of it they hate it ſo much the more.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2.6. Jer. 31.18. Iſa. 18.</note> Afflictions, When the Lord ſends it upon any of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, this is all their fruit to take away their ſin, but yet afflictions will of themſelves purge no mans Conſcience but rather defile it, as we ſee how the rage of mens ſpirits are drawn out by it, as King <hi>Ahaz</hi> ſin'd yet more, the more he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.9.10. They did gnaw their tongues with pain, and did blaſpheme the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but repented not of their evil
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:93322:66"/>deeds; bray a Fool in a Morter and yet his folly will not depart from him, but yet if Chriſts blood do ſprinkle our croſſes, they ſhall be as coraſives to eat out the proud fleſh, and they ſhall tend to heal him whom they had wounded.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Sometimes the Lord will do it by ſins, in giving him up to ſome publick open and ſcandulous fall, as he did with <hi>David,</hi> lets him fall into that great evil of murder and adultery, and that made him to waſh himſelf throughout, and it was a means to keep him low, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him from ſin all his life time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and we have the like inſtance in <hi>Peter,</hi> in denying the Lord, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and ſwearing that he never knew him; when thou art converted ſays Chriſt to him, ſtrengthen thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren, for he would be the ſtronger afterwards; as a bone broke &amp;c. and the leſs apt to fall into ſin: Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſins of themſelves being filthineſs it ſelf, cannot purge but will defile, but yet ſprinkled with the blood of Chriſt they ſhall be an occaſion of purging.</p>
            <pb n="116" facs="tcp:93322:67"/>
            <p>Sixthly, Sometimes the Lord will do it by leaving a man to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowings of Satan, in ſome furious and violent temptation, Satans aim is thereby to ſift out all grace, and to leave nothing but chaff in the ſoul, for we fight not againſt fleſh and blood <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne Heaven and Eternity, and commonly men are foiled by them, and are the more filthy by a touch of the wicked one; 1 <hi>John.</hi> 5.19. But when the Lord doth ſprinkle a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with the blood of Chriſt, it ſhall be a means to purge the ſoul, and the poyſon of it ſhall be temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a wholeſome medicine as it was unto <hi>Paul</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">A Meſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enger of Satan, &amp;c.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7.8. <hi>It is ſometime purging, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preventing Phyſick, to keep the ſoul from being lifted up, &amp;c.</hi> The ſame may be ſaid of mercies, and of all the diſpenſations of providence, for all ſhall work together for good (that is) <hi>for a mans ſpiritual and eternal good,</hi> becauſe they are all yours; Creatures and providences are as truly ſubordinate unto your good, as they are unto Gods glory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:93322:67"/>and the end of all is to take away the ſin, and to purge the Conſcience that is defiled by ſin, and to perfect holineſs in the fear of God.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The blood of Chriſt doth purge their Conſciences, as it is now ſprinkled in Heaven before the mercy Seat, by the interception of Chriſt; for there were under the Law two things that did perfect the ſacrifice, the offering of it, the killing of it, and the carrying the blood into the moſt holy place, and ſprinkling it upon the mercy Seat, and the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was not perfect until both were done, and the blood was to remain before the mercy Seat; ſo the Lord Jeſus has offer'd himſelf a ſacrifice, but his blood is ſprinkled ſtill upon us, and remains, and it is a ſpeaking blood, it ſpeaks better things then the blood of <hi>Abel;</hi> now it doth ſpeak to us continually, for the end of his blood, <hi>and what is it but that we may be cleanſed,</hi> he gave himſelf for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie us to himſelf,
<note place="margin">Tit. 2.14.</note> &amp;c. and the cry of this blood ſtill in Heaven, is, ſanctifie them by thy
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93322:68"/>truth, keep them from the evil of the world, father keep through thy own name them that thou haſt given me, &amp;c. But how ſhall I know my Conſcience is purged by the blood of Chriſt, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The more a mans Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is afflicted with the ſpiritual riſing of luſt, and he loaths himſelf for it, as <hi>Paul</hi> for the Law of his members, warring againſt the Law of his mind; and <hi>Job</hi> I have ſeen thee; and therefore I abhor my ſelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The more ready a man is to deny himſelf for God in any ſervice, and his Conſcience puts him forth to the uttermoſt in it, as <hi>Paul,</hi> I am willing to ſpend my ſelf, or to dye for the name of the Lord Jeſus, and <hi>Abraham</hi> roſe up early to obey the command of God, even to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice his only ſon; for the more the glory of God and his commands do ſway with a man, the more cauſe he has to be aſſured that the blood of ſprinkling has paſſed upon him, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The more a mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93322:68"/>keeps down h is luſt in the preſence of the object of it, as <hi>Boaz,</hi> the woman lay at his feet, and yet his luſt did not riſe; and as <hi>Job</hi> to make a Covenant with his eyes, and not look upon a Maid, not have eyes full of adultery; a godly man may be tempted to ſin, it may be in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the object; but if it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and luſt have all the advantages that can be, and yet it cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, its an argument of a pure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: and try all theſe with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto your darling luſt; <hi>for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable as the Conſcience is purged with reſpect unto that; ſo it is unto all other ſins whatſoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will ſerve for exhortation unto all men to keep their Conſciences pure,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> being once cleanſed in the blood of the Lamb, and this was the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> labour and his dayly exerciſe,

               </gap> a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience void of offence before God and all men. Now we have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard, that as there be two things in ſin, ſo there is a double defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93322:69"/>of the Conſcience, there is a guilt and a pollution, and a mans Conſcience can never be a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, a pure Conſcience, without a ſtumbling block, unleſs it be kept pure in both theſe, and here I would ſpeak of a pure Conſcience according to the Apoſtles diſtinction; Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; Secondly, before men: And firſt in reference unto the guilt of ſin, and a Conſcience polluted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and this is a heart ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. that is, an accuſing and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Conſcience, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.21. if our hearts condemn us not, that is, if they have the guilt of no ſin lye upon them, for which they draw us before the judgment Seat of Chriſt, and paſs upon us the ſentence of condemnation; and ſo <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. this is our rejoycing the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our Conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, we have had our Converſation in the world, and more eſpecially towards you, and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by my ſelf, it was a ſmall thing to him to be judged of by man, or
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93322:69"/>in mans day; for men have their day of judgment alſo, as God has his, and the reaſon why he doth deſpiſe the judgment of all men is this; that he was conſcious to himſelf of nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had misbehaved himſelf in his Apoſtleſhip towards them, many weakneſſes there were which he owned in himſelf, but yet the guilt of none of them did ſtick upon his Conſcience, and yet he refers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto the judgment of God, who knows more then a mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience can know by a mans ſelf, &amp;c. and this was the great care of <hi>Job</hi> that his heart might not reproach him all his dayes, <hi>Job</hi> 27.6.</p>
            <p>In reſpect of God, there is a two-fold good Conſcience, in regard of guilt; one in truth, and the other in ſhew and appearance only.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is a natural Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that may have a great ſhew of goodneſs in it, not having the guilt of ſin riſing in it; but may with a great deal of boldneſs appear before God, and may lift up a mans face before him, and yet this not be a Conſcience truly good, as we ſee in

               </gap>uſe, and that in the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of all men, &amp;c. therefore there is the guilt of ſome ſins that Conſcience will acquit a man from, and will ſpeak for him in the preſence of the Lord, and ſo ſome do apply that ſpeech of <hi>Paul,</hi> as <hi>Act.</hi> 23.1. <hi>I have lived in all good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence before God,</hi> even unto this day, it is conceived by ſome (as <hi>Cajetan,</hi> &amp;c.) that it is ſpoken in reference unto all his dayes, even thoſe alſo before his Converſion, in which he did never ſin againſt his Conſcience and therefore he ſaith <hi>bona Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, non bono opere;</hi> for he thought that he did God good ſervice in all that he did, as <hi>Luther</hi> did ſay of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; <hi>Nec ita eram glacies &amp; frigus, ſicut Eccius &amp; alii qui propter ventrem Papam defendere videbantur, ſed ego rem ſeriam agebam, ut qui diem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremum horribiliter timui, &amp; ſalvus fieri ex intimis medullis cupiebam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the goodneſs of a mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in not witneſſing guilt, is but a ſeeming goodneſs; it is ſometimes
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93322:70"/>from a mans uprightneſs and good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in a particular act wherein though he doth ill, yet he doth mean well and think alſo that he doth well, as it is the manner of many a miſled and deluded ſoul, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.5.6. <hi>Abimelech</hi> anſwered God, <hi>in the integrity of my heart, and the innocency of my hands have I done this,</hi> and God bears witneſs to him, that in the integrity of his heart he did it, not knowing her to be another mans wife, not with an intention to wrong her husband by taking her; there is, and may be, a moral integrity in a particular action, and a man may mean truly in that he doth, and do that which is evil, and yet not with an evil intention: Now will Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience excuſe the man in the preſence of God, and ſay, I intended no evil in that which I have done, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.2. they ſhall think that they do God good ſervice; nay in the worſt and the moſt wicked actions, even per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the Saints; a man may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive therein that he has done God ſervice, and he may bleſs himſelf in his own heart, and Conſcience may
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93322:71"/>not only acquit a man, but applaud him in that which he has done; and ſo there is many a man out of a blind zeal and a ſpirit of errour and deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that looks upon thoſe things as great ſervices to God, and intends them ſo, which will be diſcovered to be the great ſins of their lives, at the laſt day, as it was in the <hi>Jews</hi> perſecuting of Chriſt, and the Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſetting up the Law againſt the Goſpel, going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſnes, and not ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the righteouſneſs of Chriſt therein, ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 13.50. there are devout and honourable women are ſtir'd up againſt the Apoſtles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, they made uſe of that natural devotion that was in them, to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Goſpel, and as <hi>Beza</hi> doth obſerve they did raiſe the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>perſuaſis ſc. maritis,</hi> engaged their husbands in the quarrel, which is the condition of many a poor well meaning man, that is not acquainted with the depths of Satan, and the the deluſions of the times at this day.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Sometimes it is from a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93322:71"/>mans ignorance and want of light, and ſo his Conſcience he thinks is good and ſpeaks peace to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth not ſee the evil that is in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>I was alive without the Law once,</hi> he ſpeaks it in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his ſtate of unregeneracy, and he ſaith, ſin was dead in reſpect of the guilt, and the accuſing and condemning power of it, and <hi>Paul</hi> was alive, full of preſumtious ſelf-confidence, and ſelf-excuſations, and acquitting himſelf, and his Conſcience did ſpeak peace unto him, and there is no guilt at all; but yet afterwards the commandment came in the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and convincing power of it, and then the guilt of ſin revived in me, and I ſaw my ſelf a dead man; for <hi>without the Law ſin is dead:</hi> and therefore many a man that is quiet; becauſe the Law of God is not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, he has the Law in the Letter, but not in the ſpiritual ſence of it; it is with ignorant ſouls in this reſpect, as with colours in the dark, there they are, but not ſeen till the light be brought in, ſo many a man is in the guilt of all abominations;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93322:72"/>but they are not diſcovered till the light be brought in, and then a man wonders how it was poſſible his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience could be quiet, and hath ſuch a load lye upon it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, From a ſpirit of ſlumber that God pours out upon a man in judgment; his Conſcience being quiet through common works, and outward duties, a man having eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the common pollutions of the world, and lives in no groſs way of ſinning and is exceedingly cenſorious, and ſeverely exclaims againſt others, and condemns and reproves thoſe ſins in others; he doth ſhine as a light, and is honoured by the Saints, as one that doth truly fear God, and is eminent in the profeſſion of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the fooliſh Virgins, and the thorny ground; have a lamp of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion bring forth ſome fruit, has a name to live, and with this Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is quieted, and its peace is not diſturbed; and ſo it is with many a temporarie believer, that had never more then a natural Conſcience, and ſome of them their Conſcience in reſpect of the guilt of them is never
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93322:72"/>awakened, but they go out of the world even in a <hi>fools paradiſe</hi> with great hopes, and ſay, <hi>Lord, Lord,
<note place="margin">Mat. 7.22.</note> have we not propheſied in thy name,</hi> &amp;c (as they are brought in ſaying at the day of judgment, &amp;c. at death every mans eternal ſtate is caſt; for immediately after death comes judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. and in this day it is; for men ſhall have a particular ſentence paſſed upon them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their doom for their eternal ſtate before the laſt day, but at death men ſhall ſay, Lord, Lord, open to me, &amp;c. and from thence ſome of our divines ſay, that an hypocrite may live and dye with a quiet Conſcience in ſelf-deluſions, and yet miſs of Heaven in the height of his hopes, and therefore it's ſaid <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.17. of the hypocritical Jews, that they reſt in the Law, &amp;c. and ſo they may do along time in the profeſſion and outward Priviledges of the Law, and an outward obedience thereunto, that when God ſhall awaken their Conſciences (as he doth many of them) ſome to conviction only, and ſome to converſion, they are
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93322:73"/>ſurprized with the greateſt horrour and amazement of any other men in the world, and though there may be a great deal of quiet, and ſeeming goodneſs in Conſcience that is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, yet it is not truly a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; <hi>it has but a ſhew of goodneſs,</hi> and there is the guilt of ſin laid up in it that will ſurely ſhew forth it ſelf at the laſt and great day, ſin lyes at the door, and it will awaken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and condemn him: But there is away to keep the Conſcience pure from the guilt of ſin in the ſight of God, that a man ſhall have no more Conſcience of ſin, and there are three ways or ſteps to a pure Conſcience before God in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In a mans Converſion, when the Lord Chriſt as a ſurety and as a ſacrifice is offered unto him, and he conſents to the terms upon which Chriſt is offered, that he may have an intereſt in the ſatisfaction that he has given, and that his ſins may be done away, and he ſtand righteous and aquited before God, and ſo at a mans Converſion, all his ſins in his
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93322:73"/>unregenerate ſtate is pardoned, and the guilt of them is covered, ſo that they are unto his Conſcience as if they had never been; <hi>his ſins are by virtue of union, imputed to Chriſt, and Chriſts righteouſneſs imputed to him,</hi> and he is made the Lord our righteouſneſs,
<note place="margin">2 Cor 5.21 1 Pet. 3.21.</note> and we are the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God in him, which is by the anſwer of a good Conſcience, which I conceive to be an alluſion to the antient manner of baptiſing, wherein the people confeſſed their ſins, and did anſwer unto certain queſtions that were then asked, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in engaging themſelves by a publick profeſſion unto Chriſt to conſent to his Covenant, ſo when it was done ſincerely, then it is ſaid to be the anſwer of a good Conſcience; but if not, it was the anſwer of the lips only, as it was in <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> &amp;c. and hence came thoſe forms in the primitive Churches of queſtions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto the baptized perſons, to renounce the world, the fleſh and the Devil, their giving up of themſelves to Chriſt, with their ſolemn anſwer or ſtipulation thereunto; a man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93322:74"/>thus accepted of Chriſt as his ſurety, and ſacrifice, being offered unto him in the Goſpel, and given up himſelf unto him, all his ſins in the guilt of them, that were committed by him in the days of his unregenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, are all done away, his ſins are all of them put upon the head of the ſacrifice, and are taken off the man in reſpect of the guilt of them before God, as if they had never been; ſo that they ſhall never be imputed to the man any more, for the Lord hath found a ranſome.</p>
            <p>If we look upon ſin <hi>as a burden,</hi> it is taken off the ſinner,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.1.</note> and lyes upon him no more: <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.2. <hi>Take away our iniquity;</hi> It is to take the weight and the burden off the Conſcience, and lay it upon another that is able to bear it; if we look upon ſin <hi>as filthineſs,</hi> and ſo it is in pardon covered, there is a garment of Chriſts righteouſneſs drawn over the man;
<note place="margin">Zac. 4.</note> take away the filthy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, look upon ſin <hi>as an enemy,</hi> and as the guilt of it did domineer over us and inſlave us, and ſo <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.19. <hi>He will ſubdue our iniquities;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93322:74"/>and caſt them into the depth of the Sea.</hi> He will caſt them behind his back, as a thing that he will never look upon to puniſh or condemn the man for; they ſhall never be imputed unto him,

Shall be ſought for by a judicial inquiry, as the Lord will make for blood, and all manner of iniquity, they ſhall not be found (that is in judgment) that ſhall not be found unto the mens condemnation, for they are all ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for, and done away in Chriſt: So that a mans ſins ſhall never be
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93322:75"/>imputed any more. <hi>For the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is imputed unto the ſoul is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting righteouſneſs;</hi> and they ſhall therefore be as if they had never been: So that what ever a mans ſins were before his converſion, when he hath laid hold on the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and accepted of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, tendering him pardon in him, the guilt of his ſin is totally and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly taken away, and is as it had never been: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.7. <hi>Waſh me, and I ſhall be whither then Snow, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore the firſt way to have the Conſcience purged from the guilt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſin, is by the anſwer of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Whereas a believer and a juſtified perſon doth ſin againſt God, and contract new guilt every day, there muſt therefore be a dayly repentance, and a dayly application of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt unto the ſoul, and a daily and a continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> imputation on Gods part of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> righteouſneſs; and here we m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> take notice.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That a juſtified perſon is not freed from ſin, but that he doth
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93322:75"/>fall into ſin every day; we ſee it in <hi>Paul,</hi> and in <hi>David,</hi> and in the Saints.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Their daily ſins do bring upon their perſons a guilt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.10 Deliver me from blood-guiltineſs, O God, every new ſin, doth bring a new guilt, there is a double guilt of ſin; <hi>reatus perſonae &amp; peccati,</hi> the one cannot be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the ſin, but the other may, when the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is applied to the ſoul.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Lying under this guilt of a perticular ſin, God is really angry with him, not onely in his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, but God hides the light of his Countenance from him: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.3.4. <hi>While I kept ſilence, my bones conſumed away; for day and night thy hand was heavy upon me, and my moiſture is turned into the draught of Summer, Selah.</hi> He is <hi>filius ſub irae,</hi> though not <hi>ire,</hi> the Lord puts him upon a Rack and writes bitter things againſt him as if he were an enemy, and there is a ſuſpenſion, and an interdiction of all the effects of Gods juſtification, till he do repent.</p>
            <pb n="134" facs="tcp:93322:76"/>
            <p>Fourthly, Under this guilt and wrath every man ſhall lye ſo long as he continues in this ſin impenitently, when he doth believe and repent for that ſin, then it ſhall be pardoned and the guilt taken off the Conſcience, and the man reſtored unto his former ſtate to plead the priviledges of his juſtification, which he could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but was as it were under a ſtate of ſequeſtration, as the Leaper under the Law, though he had right unto all the ordinances, yet he had not the actual uſe and benefit, and injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any of them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we read, that though repentance be not a cauſe of pardon, nor Faith a cauſe of pardon, yet it is the hand that receives it, and the quallifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſubject upon whom the Lord will beſtow it: And therefore we read of a dayly ſacrifice amongſt the Jews, even a continual burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, ſo believers are to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe unto Chriſt for their dayly failings,
<note place="margin">Job. 13.10.</note> and he that is waſhed need not ſave to waſh his feet, for there is a fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th contracted by a mans daily walking, that a man muſt apply the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93322:76"/>righteouſneſs of Chriſt for, that it may be done away, and therefore <hi>David</hi> till he repented his ſin, was not pardoned (as we read of) but when he did confeſs his ſin, then <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaid unto him, the Lord hath put away thy ſin; and <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Repent and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Ezech. Repent and turn your ſelves from all your tranſgreſſions, ſo iniquity ſhall not be your ruine:</hi> And according to the Scripture, I know no ground that any man ſhould believe that his ſins are pardoned till he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, There is a daily applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt unto us by Faith, and there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual and a daily imputation of it unto us by God, and therefore we are taught by Chriſt to pray daily, Forgive us our treſpaſſes; which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a juſtified man, what can be the meaning, nothing but this, I know that my ſins are already pardoned, even all that ever I have, ſhall or can commit, let me onely have the pardon of them witneſſed unto my
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93322:77"/>ſoul; but I do conceive much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the meaning to be, as I ſin e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, and thereby do daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a new guilt, ſo grant that I may have the righteouſneſs of Chriſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto me every day, and a penitent heart given me that thereby I may have the qualifications that God requires unto pardon, and my iniquities be blotted out: For though I conceive it a truth, that juſtification as far as it reſpects a mans ſtate is done at once, and is perfect <hi>in inſtanti,</hi> that a man is but once juſtified, that is put unto a ſtate of pardon and righteouſneſs, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, as ſoon as made one with Chriſt, yet I conceive the pardon of ſin to be a continued act, that as a man doth ſin daily, ſo he has an act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual pardon daily, by the imputation of Chriſt's righteouſneſs unto him anew: The ſacrifice indeed was offered but once, and never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, but the imputation of it is continued to the end of the World and the application of it is the act of every day, and therefore ſome ſay that God does give us the ſame
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93322:77"/>things over and over again daily, as we ſin daily, and ſtand in daily need of it; as he doth the Sun, it had as much light in it the firſt day it was made as it hath now, and God has not given us a new Sun, but the ſame daily ſhines; ſo it is with the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſts obedience, who is the Son of Righteouſneſs: So that though a man be for his ſtate once for all put into a ſtate of juſtification, yet remiſſion of ſins is an act that is continued daily, and ſhall never be perfected till ſin ſhall be done away, and till the ſoul ſhall ceaſe to ſay, <hi>Lord forgive us our treſpaſſes,</hi> and then God ſhall ceaſe forgiving; but while the Saints do ſin, ſo long there is a daily remiſſion upon a daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and a renewed applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So if a man ſins daily and would have the guilt of his ſins taken off his Conſcience, it muſt be by a daily confeſſion, a daily repentance and humiliation, a daily application of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and therein by prayer ſeeking unto God for pardon daily, for I know no other means to take the guilt of ſin off the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:93322:78"/>Conſcience. Theſe things I ſpeak partly to awaken the people of God, that are juſtified freely by grace, that they might not dare to paſs a day in a way of ſinning, and that they may not dare to lye down with any ſin unrepented of alſo, and partly that thoſe abominable and dangerous doctrines that are now abroad in the world, to turn the grace of God, and the promiſes of the Goſpel into wantoneſs, may be avoided, when men ſay all our ſins are pardoned all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and therefore though we may have ſin in our converſation, yet we have none in our Conſcience, God ſees no iniquity in his people, and he loves them in Chriſt, and therefore loves them never the worſe for all their ſins, &amp;c. And therefore they need not pray for pardon, for they have it already; but onely they muſt believe that they are pardoned, and muſt believe that they need not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, for all is done away in Chriſt, and it is onely for perſons that are unregenerate to repent for ſin, and to ask pardon; but for them that are in Chriſt their ſins are pardoned, &amp;c:
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:93322:78"/>But let me tell you, and the Lord will make you know, that as you ſin every day, and contract a new guilt, ſo there is no way to get this guilt taken off thy Conſcience, but by a daily repentance for it, and a daily application of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, that thy ſins may be blotted out from the preſence of the Lord, for though thou be waſhed, yet thou haſt daily need to waſh thy feet; <hi>There is nothing that the heart of man is more willing and ready to ſhift off, then the duty of repentance,</hi> though as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith he was, <hi>nulle rei niſi penitentiae natus;</hi> and yet it is with men, as <hi>Luther</hi> ſays of himſelf, there was no word that he did hate and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor ſo much as that word, Repent; it is that, the heart of man goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and you have moſt need to be exhorted to it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is another way to keep the Conſcience pure from the guilt of ſin, and that is for a man to get aſſurance of Gods favour, the light of his countenance, and to walk in it all day long,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 89.15.</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that know the joyful ſound: They
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:93322:79"/>ſhall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance.</hi> When a man hath the witneſſes either of blood and water, which are more remote, and the ſpirit of God ſpeaks in them, and in all ordinances of the Goſpel, or elſe when a man has a more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate teſtimony from the ſpirit of God, the Lord ſaying to his ſoul, <hi>be of good cheer, thy ſins be forgiven thee;</hi> the Lord ſends his ſpirit that ſpeaks to the ſoul, as the prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David, God hath taken away thy ſin;</hi> and this is Gods ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſoul pardon and peace, which is the portion of many of the Saints, when a mans ſoul draws near to the grave, and his life to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers, and the Lord comes in and ſays deliver his ſoul from death, for I have found a ranſome; and truly there are ſouls that do walk in the light of Gods countenance all the day long, and their ſouls are as the upper Region, quiet, and are allways Calme, though ſin they do, yet they ſpeedily repent, and humble their ſouls for it, and their peace is never interrupted, nor the light of Gods
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:93322:79"/>Countenance taken from them, but they receive of his pardoning mercy dayly, and dayly bear witneſs to it that their ſins are done away, and ſo their Conſciences are never clogged with them.</p>
            <p>But as ſoon as God withdraws the light of his countenance from any poor ſoul, by and by the guilt of ſin ariſeth, and Conſcience is terrified, and there is a thick cloud over ſpreads the whole ſoul, and a mans heart is like unto a troubled Sea, that cannot reſt, ſee what reſtleſs toſſings <hi>David</hi> was in while his ſin lay upon his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and God hid his face day and night, they are ſo heavy upon me that all the night long I make my bed to ſwim with my tears, oh take me not out of thy preſence, will the Lord caſt off for ever, and his mercy is it clean gone, will he be gracious no more? Thus a man that would have a clear Conſcience in reſpect of guilt, muſt make it his buſineſs to walk in the light of Gods Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance all the day.</p>
            <p>Having thus far ſeen how a man may keep a Conſcience pure from the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:93322:80"/>guilt of ſin. Let us now come to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, how a mans Conſcience may be preſerved pure, from the defilement and the pollution of ſin: And here we are to conſider, that there are two things in Conſcience, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable unto them there is a defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that may befall a mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>Firſt, there is a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is the ſeat of practical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as there is a judgment in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that it can make of what is true, and what is falſe, what is good, and what is evil.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> I knowing and a judging of mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and his wayes by theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and the acts of Conſcience that follow thereupon, and the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of either of theſe will pollute the Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is a <hi>Syntereſis</hi> which are the principles by which men are acted in their ways, which are the rules by which a man walks, and by which he doth judge of himſelf and of all his ways, and by which he doth direct and ſteer his whole courſe, if
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:93322:80"/>theſe be true, the Conſcience is ſo far kept pure, that though a man may ſin againſt his knowledge, and be carryed away by the violence of temptation, yet it is contrary unto the rule and the principle that is within him; there is ſomething in him that is contrary to it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns it, and takes part with God and with duty; and the more a mans judgment and Conſcience is leavened with corrupt principles, the more is his Conſcience defiled; <hi>a man muſt hold the myſtery of faith in a pure Conſcience;
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.9. 1 Tim. 1.19.</note> holding Faith and a good Conſcience, which ſome having put away concerning the Faith, have made ſhipwrack;</hi> for the myſtery of faith muſt be kept in a pure Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for if your judgments be lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened with corrupt principles, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9. you will ſoon make ſhipwrack of the faith, which ſignifies a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and an irrecoverable loſs of it: And here I will ſpeak to theſe three things. Firſt, That there is a great deal of danger that mens Conſciences may be defiled in their principles, and they corrupted in judgment.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93322:81"/>Secondly, The greatneſs of this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, what an evil it is for a man to have his judgment defiled, and the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of that Conſcience corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thirdly, The means and rules how a man may be preſerved from a polluted Conſcience in this, how a mans judgment may be kept unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and you had need to take heed; for there is a great deal of danger that your judgment may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe there is a great deal of darkneſs in all Goſpel-adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in compariſon of what we do expect the Lord ſhall give unto his people in the latter dayes, when <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Temple ſhall be built, the Lord will ſhew his people all the forms and the patterns of his houſe, and the goings in and the comings out thereof, and in the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet, which refers unto the ſame time; <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. laſt, for then the miſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed, the Temple ſhall be opened, and we ſhall ſee into the Ark of the Teſtimony, it had a vail before it that it might not be ſeen; but the moſt
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93322:81"/>hidden and ſecret things ſhall then be made manifeſt, and clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and by the Ark ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of Chriſt, of whom the Ark was a type: there ſhould be a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and a more glorious manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him in all Church ordinances and adminiſtrations than ever there had been in times paſt; But mean while there is a Sea of Glaſs, but it is mixed with fire, there is a great deal of affliction, and bitter conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Temple is fill'd with ſmoak, a great darkneſs upon all ordinances, in ſo much that during all the time of the pouring out of the Vials, no man (that is) no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable and great company of men, ſhould be brought into the Church, here and there a few converted, but none in compariſon of the fulneſs of Jews and Gentiles that ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to God afterwards, when the ſmoak of the Temple ſhall be diſpel'd and done away; and if there be ſo much darkneſs, it is no wonder if men be in danger to be deceived, and to be led away from the truth, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if men in the dark may eire, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93322:82"/>miſs their way, and therefore I would not have men as not too cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious of others, ſo not too confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of their own way, in any thing that they have not a clear war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for in the Word, for ſurely this is the time of the Vials, and it is ſpoken of the reformed Churches, they that while the Vials were pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering upon Antichriſt, did ſtand with the Lamb upon mount <hi>Sion,</hi> that had gotten victory over the Beaſt and his Image, and did ſing the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the Lamb, &amp;c. and yet amongſt them; the Temple was full of ſmoak, and therefore there is danger that you may be deceived and deluded, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There be a great many falſe teachers gone abroad in the World; 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.1. <hi>Beloved believe not every ſpirit, but try the ſpirits whether they are of God, becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny falſe Prophets are gone out &amp;c.</hi> It hath been the way that Satan has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in all reſormations, as ſoon as ever the Goſpel began to dawn in the World, in the Apoſtles times, there aroſe men of themſelves. that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93322:82"/>did ſpeak perverſe things; <hi>Act.</hi> 20.30. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is, ſuch things, as turn all upſide down, that ſubvert and overthrow all the principles and foundations of the doctrine of Chriſt, that have been laid by himſelf and his Apoſtles.
<note place="margin">Rev. 12.</note> And when their was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> then another floud of hereſy was caſt out after the woman. So in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in <hi>Luthers</hi> time; if the Lord do but ſow good ſeed, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my will come and ſow tares, and we ſee how much confidence Satan puts in this way of prevailing; for it is his laſt remedy that he ſhall uſe to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the kingdom of Antichriſt: as we ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.13. The Vial being powred out upon the ſeat of the Beaſt, and <hi>Rome</hi> falling as a Millſtone into the Sea, without hope of recovery; and now there is a new Church ariſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, coming out of the Wilderneſs, leaning upon her Beloved, and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> dryed up to make way for the Kings of the Eaſt: Now he doth ſend out of the mouth of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eaſt, and the Dragon, and ſalfe Prophet three unclean ſpirits like Frogs, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93322:83"/>they are the ſpirits of Devils work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miracles, and going forth into the Kings of the earth, &amp;c. They are ſaid to be ſpirits for their activity, and impetiouſneſs (ſo ſome) but I rather think they are called ſpirits, that is falſe teachers, becauſe they pretend to ſpeak by the ſpirit, as 1 <hi>John.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Believe not every ſpirit, but try the ſpirits whether they be of God;</hi> and they are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is not the ordinary word that is uſed for the Devil, but a word doth expreſs knowledg and learning, &amp;c. They ſhall ſend forth there moſt learned men of the greateſt parts, and the beſt wits, and they that ſhall teach ſpirits as Frogs, they that ſhall teach unclean and corrupt and filthy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and by this means, and by Satans aſſiſting them in their doctrine, and backing it with miracles and great works, they ſhall gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Kings of the earth againſt the Church of God to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and final overthrow; ſurely, therefore there is a great deal of danger, that a man may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and his judgment may be
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93322:83"/>corrupted becauſe it is the laſt refuge of Satan that he has to uphold his kingdome by ſending forth unclean ſpirits.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Moſt men unto whom theſe ſpirits come,
<note place="margin">Heb. 5.13.</note> they find them children; for he that is unskilful in the word of righteouſneſs, he is a babe, and therefore being children in underſtanding,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.14.</note> and not men ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the principles of the doctrine of Chriſt, therefore they are toſt to and fro, with every wind of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, toſſed as a wave, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about as a cloud, and from theſe two, the Metaphors are taken, if the wind be this way, the wave is born and the cloud carryed about, and if the wind do turn, it is blown the contrary way; they lead captive ſilly woman, <hi>omnes haereſes ex gyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caeis,</hi> is a proverb in the ancient Church, and the more ingnorant any people are the eaſier are they turned away from the truth, and the ſooner do they give ear to fancies, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and he that ſhall conſider the ignorance of our people in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion, and that in a great
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93322:84"/>many of thoſe that profeſs Religion, and think themſelves to be knowing Chriſtians, and yet have but only a general and a ſmattering confuſed knowledge, and a man would be far from wondering that ſo many were corrupted, but rather he would wonder that all were not taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by Satan.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Falſe teachers uſe a great deal of artifice to that end, that they may deceive, and they do it under the faireſt ſhows, and the moſt ſpecious pretences, Antichriſt (<hi>Rev.</hi> 17.3.) gives the wine of her formention in a Golden Cup, that is, that by which it is offered unto the world, it is a very alluring and taking way, and as a Harlot whoſe lips do drop as the hony-comb, and all is under a ſhow of love unto Chriſt, and a colour of love to you, a pity to ſee you ſo deceived, there is a <gap reason="foreign">

<note place="margin">Rev. 13.</note> and we know that Antichriſt when he roſe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93322:85"/>had two horns like a Lamb, and <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith of <hi>Pelagius, Nomen Pellagii non ſine lande poſui, quia vita cita ejus à multis praedicabatur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea Satan doth creep into <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, and he may be corrupted, and <hi>Barnabas</hi> alſo with that diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; for they ſhall deceive if it were poſſble even the very elect, though totally and finally it is not poſſible, but yet they may far deceive them; for indeed there be many that hold the foundation, and whoſe ſouls may be ſaved in the day of the Lord, yet may build Hay and Stubble upon the foundation: and therefore we ſhould leave room for charity towards ſome, who have not had that touch of Satan upon their ſpirits that others have, and endeavour to pluck them as fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands out of the fire, that they may not wreſt the Scriptures to their own deſtruction, but pray that the Lord would deliver them from the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and ſeducements of Satan, &amp;c. diſcover his Wiles to them, that they may ſay, was there not an errour in my right hand, and men are ſo much the rather to be pityed; becauſe being
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93322:85"/>ignorant and unlearned they more eaſily become the prey of falſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who are very induſtrious and la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>borious, and lay out themſelves to the utmoſt,
<note place="margin">Math.</note> they will compaſs Sea and Land to make a Proſelite, they compel you to be Circumciſed, that they may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in your fleſh, that is, <hi>multitudine ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacium,</hi> in the multitude of their Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and followers, ſome men think it is an excellent thing to be the founder of a new ſect, as they ſaid of <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 24.5.</note> he was a ring-leader of the ſect of the <hi>Nazarenes;</hi> I know that many ſay this by way of reproach to the people of God, that would walk out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the world, that they are but ſectaries, and brand them dayly with new names, and new light, &amp;c. becauſe they would not have their old darkneſs be diſcovered, but this is but one of the fig leaves of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts covering, which ſhall fall off from him, and he ſhall fly away naked, and men ſhall ſee his ſhame notwithſtanding.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, There is a mighty power of Satan and an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that goes along with them, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:93322:86"/>as ſoon as Antichriſt did but appear in the world, by and by all the world wandred after the Beaſt, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Image, and his mark in their right hand, and in their foreheads, men will he quickly engaged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves in ſuch a way, and having received the mark in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, they will receive it in their right hand, to defend it, and ſtand for it, ſo that a man would wonder to ſee men ſo ſoon turn'd after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpel; and their words fret as a Gangrene or a Cancer, that doth quickly infect all that comes near it, and we may ſee what ſtrong poiſon this liquor of Antichriſt is, and what a deceit it is by the power of it, not only upon the ignorant, but upon the learned, and not only upon them that were a lump fit to receive any leaven, but even thoſe that were counted (and we may hope) to be Godly men, of eminent parts, and great abilities, and men that have done great ſervices, and ſhine as great lights, and are great preachers that have converted Souls to God, and yet the Dragons Tail ſweeps
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93322:86"/>away the third part of the Stars of Heaven, and caſts them unto the Earth, &amp;c. Now all theſe eonſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ſhould prevail with us, <hi>that he that thinks he ſtands, may take heed leſt he fall;</hi> becauſe there is a great danger of deceiving the beſt and the holieſt and the wiſeſt men, and turn them aſide from the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, I ſhould have been more particular in the diſcovery of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, in all his colours, eſpecially <hi>that great Character</hi> and ſtamp which is on all his followers <hi>to be perſecutors of the Saints</hi> of the moſt high, who refuſe to worſhip his Image, or to receive his mark; but that I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to treat on more largely; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I look upon the time of the kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the witneſſes to draw near; for which the ſpirits of men are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly qualified: and therefore the Saints had need to ſtand upon their watch Tower; for the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet, &amp;c. conſpire againſt them.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. Conſidert is a very dangerous thing for a man to be deceived; for firſt a mans judgment being corrupted
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:93322:87"/>it will make way for a very corrupt converſation, <hi>no man is better then his judgment,</hi> but men generally, I may ſay, all men are worſe; now they are the greateſt corruptions that are the fruits of corrupt doctrine, and their doctrines do back them, and are not the fruits of their luſts only, as we ſee it in the Phariſees, all their fins were juſtified by their doctrines, and they had ſo fitted it, as it ſerved to maintain their wicked wayes; there is a ſpirit of uncleaneſs goes with the falſe prophet whereſoever he goes; <hi>Rome</hi> is ſpiritually <hi>Egypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zach. 13.</note> and <hi>Sodons</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> compares the falſe teachers in his times with the worſt of ſinners, and ſurely their latter end is worſe then their beginning, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. it's happened unto them according to the true proverb, the dog is turn'd to his vomit again, &amp;c.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It is a hard matter for a man to repent being once engaged,
<note place="margin">Gal. 3.1.</note> and taken with it; for it's ſaid men are bewitched that they do believe that lye of Popery, eſpecially that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93322:87"/>ſay, is there not a lye in my right hand, and falſe doctrine is compared to leaven, and if it be mixed with dough, it is very hard if not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ever to ſeparate them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we read of very few men that ever appeared much againſt any truth of God that ever have returned, but they in their pride did perſiſt, and God did give them up though they were convinced themſelves, and ſpake lyes in hypocriſie; and knew them to be ſo, yet for all this they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of them; for God in judgment gave them up unto a Conſcience ſeared with a hot Iron: <hi>and truly it is a fearfull judgment to be given up of God to believe a lye,</hi> and it is to a man a very dangerous ſign that he is not of the ſheep of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Joh. 10.5.</note> a ſtranger they will not follow, they know not the voice of a ſtranger, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the rottenneſs of mens hearts may be manifeſted, there muſt be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ſayes the Apoſtle for that end; and that they that are approved may be made manifeſt alſo.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They are called damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hereſies; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. In a double
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:93322:88"/>reſpect. Firſt, They are a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſign and token of damnation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that are enſnared by them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. They that do pertake in the doctrine of <hi>Popery,</hi> they are thoſe whoſe names are not written in the Lambs book, and they are ſuch as in themſelves deſerve damnation; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all ſin is in its own nature dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and ſo muſt this be in a ſpecial manner, in a way of eminency ſo called, ſuch as <hi>Judas</hi> is called, the Son of perdition, becauſe he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto a more then ordinary diſtruction; and the Pope the man ſin, becauſe eminent in ſinning; ſo here <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, becauſe they come under a more remarkable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction then other ſins do, and the Lord ſays their damnation ſleeps not, they were of old ordained thereunto, <hi>Jude</hi> 4. But I would not be miſtaken in all this and grieve the hearts of any tender Conſcience, whom the Lord would not have grieved that hold ſome leſſer errours, which may be becauſe we ſee with different Lights. Nay, I deny not but a godly man may be deceived in ſome errours,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93322:88"/>that happily do ſtrike at the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo for a time, but he doth not continue in them; but I ſay to hold them, and continue in them, as it makes way for a more eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, ſo it is a moſt dangerous ſign of reprobation.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It is a very dangerous fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of judgment unto a nation, and of Gods removing the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, and giving a Church a Bill of Divorce, you may ſee it in the Church of Rome; and if men will be Idolaters, and Blaſphemers, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Reſurection, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, if men countenance the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Jezebel,</hi> and the Doctrine of the <hi>Nicholaitans,</hi> it will follow that Chriſt will quickly come againſt them, and fight againſt them with the ſword of his mouth: The laſt times of the Jewiſh Church were infected with hereſy, which bred diviſions, and ſuch diſtraction amongſt them till it deſtroyed the whole face and frame of Church and common wealth; and in the laſt times there ſhall be the moſt dangerous Doctrines broached, till the Lord ſhall avenge
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:93322:89"/>his truth by a judgment upon the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet; Gods truth is dear to him, he has exalted his word above all his name; <hi>and the opening of his boſome, and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of truth in the World, has coſt the blood of the Son of God:</hi> He could never have been a Prophet, if he had not been a Prieſt, all his offices, and the performance of them depend upon his Prieſthood, and no man ſhall have a benefit by Chriſt as he is a Prophet, or as he is a Prieſt, or as he is a King, that has him not firſt as his Prieſt, and cloſed with him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and his word is the great <hi>expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum</hi> that God has ſtretched forth over Kingdoms, and Nations. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. By this he judges them, and hews them, and ſlayeth them, he will not ſuffer the diſhonour of it, nor his people cannot bear it, but Rivers of tears run down, becauſe men keep not the Law of God, and ſo many have ſhed their blood for it, and indured cruel tortures, and mockings, and wandered about the World, to carry the Goſpel, where the ſound of it was not heard; and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93322:89"/>if they cannot bear it, ſurely Chriſt himſelf will bear it much leſs: And therefore let me tell you, if a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome were as dear unto God as the ſignal upon his right hand, he would pluck it thence and if any people ſhall go about it, to ſet up themſelves, and vent their own Luſts, and do think to accompliſh their ends by cutting down and deſtroying the Scriptures, truly God will not bear it, but that Word ſhall be armed againſt them that they have deſpiſed, and ſhall certainly overtake them; <hi>Zac.</hi> 1.6. It may lye upon the ground for a while in the eſteem of men, but God will cauſe it again to ariſe, and all the ſtrength of fleſh ſhall fall before it, for it is this word that plants king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and plucks them up; and God will certainly call this nation to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for his Word that has been abuſed by it, and turned behind our backs, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>How ſhould a man keep his judgment pure, that his principles be not corrupted?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Get a humble and a ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying heart; There are two great
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93322:90"/>cauſes of a mans turning unto errour in the Scripture, one is pride and a deſign to be ſome body in matter of knowledg, <gap reason="foreign">

They ſerve not God but their own Bellies; now that man that ſeeks the truth of God for the truths ſake, and neither to gain ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by it before men, nor to compaſs any other worldly end, he will not eaſily be biaſſed and led away by the errours of the times, and if he ſhould be miſtaken in any thing, we may hope that the truth will be revealed to him in time, though we may ſee him turn aſide for the preſent.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Get thy heart filled with the love of the truth, and thou wilt not be eaſily carried from it, for the word being received in a good and honeſt heart,
<note place="margin">Luk. 8.15.</note> it doth abide there
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93322:90"/>and holds out and brings forth fruit with patience; <hi>Alexander</hi> was a companion with the Apoſtle in his tribulation and ſufferings, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great perſecution for the truth of God, and yet proved a Heretick, a bitter enemy unto the Goſpel, a blaſphemer, and what was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? Becauſe he had not an honeſt heart, nor an inward love unto the Word, that he did teach and profeſs; he put away a good Conſcience,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.20.</note> and he did cheriſh himſelf in ſome known ſin, and therefore he did make ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of the Faith,
<note place="margin">2 Theſ.</note> they were given up to believe that lye, becauſe they received not the truth in the love of it, if we make truth but matter of talk, we ſhall never be able to ſtand faſt in it or profeſs it; if perfecution ariſe for the word ſake, or if falſe Doctrine be ſpread we ſhall be taken with it, <hi>for it is not Learning, but Love, that makes a man conſtant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Truth;</hi> the greateſt Schollars have fallen from it, and have denyed the truth, and the weakeſt have ſtood to it and profeſſed it, in the time when it was perſecuted, and it
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93322:91"/>is becauſe the one did know much, but the other did love much, they had claimed it as their inheritance, and therefore no wonder they ſtood for it, but other men concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for it but as Lawyers do other mens evidences, and therefore they care not greatly which way the Cauſe goes when it comes to a hearing and debate; for they have their Fee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand for their labour; <hi>ſo it is eaſie to looſe that out of a mans head, that he never had in his heart,</hi> nor never cared to have. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Get your hearts well grounded in the principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the doctrine that is according to godlineſs, and ſtick to that, there is an <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93322:91"/>Deſciples after them, &amp;c. But I commend you to God and the word of his grace, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2. they ſhall bring in damnable hereſies, and many ſhall follow their pernicious wayes, but be mindfull of the words of the Prophets and Apoſtles, give heed to them as to a light ſhining in a dark place, and keep cloſe to the Miniſtry thereof, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. he hath given ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangiliſts, and ſome Paſtures and Teachers for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, &amp;c. that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth we ſhould not be as children;

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Take heed of affecting curioſities in Religion, and to dote upon queſtions that miniſter ſtrife and not edifying; for by theſe many men are ſeduced and ſubverted, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:93322:92"/>there is no truth of God but is precious, and things revealed belong to us and our children, and whatever things are written are written for our learning, and we ſhould deſire to be filled with all the knowledge of his Will,
<note place="margin">Col. 1.9.</note> but yet there is a deſire of knowledge that is dangerous even in the things of God; Firſt, when neglecting the great things and they that are neceſſary, all our enquiries run out into niceties and leſſer things, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2. as new born babes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the ſincere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby, and <hi>John</hi> 16.12. I have many things to ſay to you, but you cannot bear them now, they will do you harm, they will do you more harm then good; becauſe you are not capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them;
<note place="margin">Rom 14.1</note> we read that a man weak in the faith, is not to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into doubtfull diſputations, and therefore he ſhould not thruſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into doubtfull diſputations; Secondly, when men deſire know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the general that is only for knowledge ſake, and not that he may be perfect throughly furniſhed
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:93322:92"/>to every good work, &amp;c. it is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that is according to godlineſs that we ſhould deſire, and if the end of any thing in Religion be in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge only, and it reſts there, thou wilt eaſily be corrupted; for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is the bait with which thou wilt be taken,
<note place="margin">Col. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> if it be but a ſhow of wiſdom only, which does not lead to practiſe, it will come to nothing; for the end of the truths of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing revealed to us, is not for our talking but doing, not for the ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of mens parts, but their graces and vertues.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Receive nothing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion upon credit and the authority of man, be he never ſo learned and never ſo holy,
<note place="margin">Math.</note> call no man father upon Earth, no man Rabbi upon Earth, ſearch the Scriptures,
<note place="margin">Act. 17.11 John 4.1.</note> try the ſpirits, take nothing upon truſt, its no diſparagement unto the beſt Miniſtry to ſubject their doctrine to the Scriptures, Chriſt himſelf ordered us to ſubject his doctrine to the tryal, ſearch the Scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life, they teſtifie of me, and by this he
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:93322:93"/>did confirm his doctrine; <hi>if once you take things from the authority of man, you ſet the man in the place of Chriſt,</hi> and God in judgment may give him up to errour that you may be miſlead by him, who was ſo willing to follow his Commandment: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. <hi>You were caried away with dumb Idols, as you were led;</hi> the blind lead the blind, it is an honour due to God, onely to be believed, <hi>ex au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate dicentis.</hi> And therefore away with the names of men, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> and I of <hi>Apollo,</hi> &amp;c. For <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> &amp;c. Is nothing but inſtruments by whom you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; and there cannot be a greater injury to your Teachers, then to ſet them in the place of Chriſt, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Avoid as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Society with thoſe by whom thou mayeſt be drawn to be ſeduced, ceaſe to hear that inſtruction that cauſeth thee to err from the way of knowledge; <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.27.

            <p>Laſtly, Be much in prayer to be preſerved, when ſo many, even the third part of the Stars of Heaven be ſwept down, that thou mayeſt ſtand with the Lamb, and not receive the mark of the Beaſt, when the World wonders after him it is a great mercy; and therefore ſay,
<note place="margin">Can. 1.7.</note> Lord ſhew me where thou feedeſt, where thou makeſt thy flocks to reſt at noon, for why ſhould I be as one that turneth aſide by the flocks of thy compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, remember <hi>it is not parts, nor learning, nor common grace that will ſecure a man from believing lyes;</hi> for we ſee men of the greateſt parts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are taken, the wits and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputers of this World, and it is not a form of godlyneſs, nor a profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion, but it is walking cloſe with God in that profeſſion; we ſee
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:93322:94"/>men in our days that have driven the trade of Religion for many years together, and yet may become but broaken profeſſors, and prove bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt at laſt, become the Leaders of ſome new Sect, and there the height of their Religion ends; and if once thy heart ſit looſe in prayer, even in this know thou art immediately in danger to be corrupted and ſeduced, <hi>for if once a man ceaſe to pray againſt ſin, thou art in danger to commit it;</hi> this is the way for a man to keep his Conſcience pure in the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of it, that his judgment be not defiled: But there is a double miſery, that we do labour under at this time, as there are hereſies and falſe doctrines on the one ſide, and you muſt keep your Conſciences pure from that leaven, ſo alſo there is profaneneſs and all manner of deviliſh practiſes on the other ſide, and men do commonly think by objecting the one to juſtify themſelves in the other, ſome are enemies unto Chriſt in opinion, teaching for doctrines the traditions of men, and there are ſome are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Chriſt in converſation, whoſe
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93322:94"/>god is their belly, who glory in their ſhame, and give themſelves over unto all exceſs of riot; <hi>Chriſt has enemies, even where his kingdom is ſet up:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal 110 2</note> For he muſt rule in the middle of his enemies, the time will come when he ſhall rule over them, but now he rules amongſt them, and thoſe enemies are of three ſorts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Some are Chriſtians but not in purity, as Hereticks and falſe teachers, and ſome are Chriſtians, but not in ſincerity, as hypocrites and thoſe that are falſe hearted; and laſtly ſome are called Chriſtians, but have not ſo much as an external con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and ſuch are prophane and all profeſſed workers of iniquity, and there is onely this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; <hi>one ſpeaks againſt the Truth, and the other lives againſt the Truth;</hi> and ſo all the benefits that we have by having the name of Chriſt called upon us, is this, <hi>ad hoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantum preceptorum ſacrorum ſcite cognoſcimus; ut poſt interdict a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius peccemus.</hi> It will be neceſſary therefore that ſomething be ſpoken
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:93322:95"/>to fortifie your ſouls, and to exhort you to keep your Conſciences pure, from principles of prophaneneſs in converſation, as well as principles of hereſy in opinion, for all mens ways are grounded upon the principles with which their mind is ſtored, and by theſe the man walks, and therefore the great work in converſion is to diſtroy mens former principles, and caſt down their ſtrong holds, and bring their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> reaſonings into ſubjection; lay but theſe two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in a mans heart, that the Church cannot err, and that the Church of Rome is the true Church onely, and that man though he know not or conſent not unto many of the doctrines of <hi>Popery,</hi> yet he is a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt</hi> in his principles, and theſe will neceſſarily bring in all the reſt, and inforce the man to conſent unto them all, as they ſhall be diſcovered to him; ſo there are certain principles that if they be layd in a mans heart, though he may not walk in many ways of Prophaneneſs, but for ſome reaſons there is a reſtraint upon him, yet he is in his heart a prophane man,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:93322:95"/>and will be ready to break forth into all the ways of prophaneneſs, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion and opertunity ſhall preſent it ſelf, and the principles are ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That is the beſt Religion that men do receive by tradition from their Fathers; ſo they in <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.17. Our Fathers did burn incenſe to the Queen of Heaven, and then they had plenty of victuals, but ſince there has been innovations, and changes in Religion, we have never ſeen peace nor a good day: Have any of the nations changed their gods?

When as we know that Chriſt dyed to redeem us from our vain converſation that we received by tradition from our Fathers; and men meerly acquainted with the

               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:93322:96"/>Scriptures, do know that God has promiſed unto his people, a greater diſcovery of truth in the latter days, the light of the Moon ſhall be as the light of the Sun,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 26.30.</note> &amp;c. And the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God ſhall be opened in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and they ſhall ſee into the ark of the Teſtament,
<note place="margin">Rev. 11.</note> and the Sea of glaſs that was firſt clear, afterwards became as the blood of a dead man, and afterwards a Sea mixed with fire, will be at laſt a clear River of the waters of Life clear as Chriſtal again, and <hi>that the Lord will never leave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining and purging Religion,
<note place="margin">Rev. 22.</note> till he has taken of all that filthineſs and defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Antichriſt that he hath eaſt upon it:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12.28.</note> This ſhall be the gain that we ſhall have by all the ſhaking of the things that are made, a removing of all things in Religion, that have onely the ſtamp and authority of man upon them, which we are to wait and pray for.</p>
            <p>Secondly, So much in Religion as will ſtand with a mans credit, profit, and honour in the World, that they can admit of, but it is not good to be ſingular, and too preciſe therein,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:93322:96"/>this was the principle that was in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hues</hi> heart, ſo much reformation as would eſtabliſh the kingdome unto himſelf and his poſterity, he was zealous for, but no more; but if any thing do croſs that, then men riſe up againſt it, with <hi>Demetrius</hi> they will not hear of it, for by this craft we get our wealth, &amp;c. As the King of <hi>Navar</hi> anſwered <hi>Beza</hi> when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted him to own the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Cauſe, and to appear for them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he profeſſed to favour them, his anſwer was <hi>ſe iſtoc pelago commiſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> &amp;c. He would ſo far go and ſhew himſelf and Lanch into this Sea, that he would make ſure of a ſafe harbour; ſo men will go no further in Religion then may ſtand with worldly intereſt, and <hi>mens policies do ſet bounds unto their piety,</hi> as we ſee by woful experience this day, &amp;c. Whereas the Goſpel rule is, that a man muſt in the things of God <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Let him utterly deny himſelf, and he that loves Father and Mother more then me, is not worthy of me, <hi>God hates that Religion that ſhall coſt men nothing;</hi> the Lord calls
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:93322:97"/>for ſingularity in Religion, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> what ſingular thing do you? and what do you more then others? you talk more, but do you do more and hazard more, &amp;c. As ſingularity in a way of ſin and pride is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to God; ſo <hi>ſingularity in a way of holineſs is well pleaſing to him;</hi> and for ſuch is the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven prepared, it's a ſtraight gate and a narrow way, and there be few that find it: the Lords flock is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle flock, they are a ſingular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, they do not walk in the drove with the reſt of the world, but they follow the Lamb whereſoever he goes, through thick and through thin as we uſe to ſay.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They ſay there is no neceſſity of a work of converſion and regeneration as men do talk of; for they that are born in the Church as we all are, we are born in true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion alſo, it is the Heathens and Papiſts that are to be converted; ſo did the Phariſees think that they needed no repentance, though they could not deny but that they did ſin and in many things offend: therefore
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:93322:97"/>they muſt grant a repentance for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular acts of ſin; but as for that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentence which we call initial, the change of a mans ſtate, that they did conceive the Heathen had need of, but they had not; for they were the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> born in the Church, to whom the Covenants did belong, &amp;c. and men ſay there is no ſuch inward power of godlineſs upon the heart as men ſpeak of, contrary to what Chriſt ſayes to <hi>Nicodemus, unleſs a man be born again he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> and that to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. and 1 <hi>John.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.18. and yet they dare to ſay that all that profeſs it do but diſſemble, and they are hypocrites, and it is ridiculous for the Church to require ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the workings of God upon their hearts before they are admited into the Church fellowſhip, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters now adays teach their people a canting language, which all are to ſpeak or elſe they are no Church Members, whereas they ſay Religion conſiſts in a fair outward juſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamable carriage before men, they
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:93322:98"/>have a form of godlineſs, as ſayes the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">Tim. 2.3.5</note> but deny the power of it; and ſo the phariſees they did juſtifie themſelves before men, they were ſuch as Sepulchres are that were out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly fair, made clean the outſide only. <hi>So theſe are civil men which are the worlds Saints,</hi> whereas alſo there is an inward work wanting upon the heart, there is a being changed in the ſpirit of their mind, which they never experienced, a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that exceeds the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, and with out this converting grace all their works are loſt, <hi>not tantum peccata ſed &amp; bona opera mortalia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, They ſay it is an eaſie thing to repent, it is but to cry, Lord have mercy upon us, and I am ſorry for my ſin, when I am laid upon my death bed and I can no longer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, then I hope I ſhall repent; but Chriſt ſayes its not ſo eaſie to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; <hi>it's eaſier for a Camel to go through the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to enter there,</hi> and therefore he bids them ſtrive to enter; <hi>Judas</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:93322:98"/>did repent here, and yet he is gone to Hell that is his place, and truly there is and will be repentance enough in Hell, to eternity, if any repentance would ſerve the turne, men may eaſily repent;
<note place="margin">Acts 5.31.</note> I but <hi>God accepts no repentance but true repentance,</hi> and its God only that gives repentance unto life, and being it is in his power, Oh that the day of his power may be upon all that hear me this day that you may not think it ſo eaſie a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to do this great work, take heed leaſt thy heart be hardened with the deceitfulneſs of ſin.
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, They think God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull and count it no hard matter to get the pardon of ſin, and think it not ſo great an evil as it is made out to be; but a godly man that has been convinced of ſin and converted from it, he looks upon ſin as the greateſt evil, and ſees all kind of evil in it, and every ſin to abound in ſinfulneſs, and that there is more evil in it then in Hell it ſelf; for that is but againſt a created good, and this againſt an uncreated good, and the glory of God is dearer then
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:93322:99"/>Heaven and Earth to them. Secondly, The price that was paid to purchaſe our pardon from ſin and defilement, was the blood of Chriſt, we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption through his blood even the forgiveneſs of ſins. Thirdly, That all a mans comfort comes in by it,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 40.1.</note> ſays God, ſpeak comfortably to her and tell her that her fins are pardoned, <hi>be of good cheer for thy ſins are forgiven,</hi> and Gods people many of them that walk in bitterneſs all their dayes, and have ſad hearts, and they pray, and their ſouls draw near to the grave: and all this God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits that he might raiſe the price of pardon in their hearts, when he bids them be of good cheer their ſins are forgiven, and then their fleſh comes again as the fleſh of a young child. Theſe and many the like principles of prophaneſs there is in the hearts of men; and theſe being once granted they do bear a great ſway with a man in his whole life.</p>
            <p>Thus we have ſeen how to keep a pure Conſcience in reſpect of the principles in mens hearts. Now let us come to the ſecond which is how
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:93322:99"/>to keep Conſcience pure in reſpect of practiſe, and therein two things are to be ſpoken to. Firſt, The notes of a defiled Conſcience. Secondly, Rules how to preſerve it pure from defilement.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Marks how to judge of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement of a mans Conſcience, as firſt, when a man ſins much againſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<note place="margin">Tit. 1.15.</note> and <hi>to ſin againſt knowledge is one of the higheſt aggravations of ſin,</hi> and it makes every ſin to be preſumptious and qualifies a man;
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.27</note> for the great tranſgreſſion if a mans ſin will fully after he has received the knowledge of the truth, if you had been blind you had had no ſin, the Phariſees and the people committed the ſame ſin, they all perſecuted Chriſt; but the Phariſees ſin'd againſt the Holy Ghoſt in it, and the people did it ignorantly and repented; <hi>ſins that are ignorantly commited leave a door open to mercy, Paul</hi> obtained mercy; for I did it ignorantly in unbelief, yet though he did it ignorantly there was need of mercy, but becauſe he did it ignorantly, therefore there was hope of mercy, there was place for mercy,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93322:100"/>and the more the light is of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and example, the greater the ſin, it is a great advantage to have good education, <hi>Pro.</hi> 22.6. <hi>Train up a Child in the way he ſhould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it,</hi> and ſo <hi>Pro.</hi> 31.1. it was that which his mother taught him; and <hi>Timothy</hi> knew the Scriptures from a child; and examples do aggravate ſins, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.10. <hi>In a Land of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs will he deal unjuſtly,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. Thou <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> haſt not humbled thy heart, though thou knoweſt all this; to have a light within a man, as well as example without, to have been once enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and taſted of the heavenly gift and then fall away, it's impoſſible to renew them unto repentance, for a man to turn away from profeſſed light, and caſt up his vomit and lick it up again, and as a waſhed Sow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the myre again, and after many years enquiring of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with <hi>Saul</hi> the Witches. This is a dreadfull ſtate, and ſuch a one had better never to have known the wayes of God, &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="183" facs="tcp:93322:100"/>
            <p>Secondly, When a man reſolves to reſerve to himſelf any way of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Joh</hi> 20.12. Some ſweet Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and the man hides it; ſee it in <hi>Herod,</hi> he did hear <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt gladly, and did many things, but there was a <hi>Herodias</hi> that he did reſerve and was reſolved he could not part with it; ſo there is a way of wickedneſs that men will not turne from, as there are fundamentals in faith, and errours in theſe are moſt dangerous to deſtroy the foundation; ſo there are ſome fundamentals in practiſe, and they will ſubvert all, and <hi>this is one of the main that a man deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in every known ſin,</hi> pluck out the right eye, and cut off the right hand, and there is no man that is more pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted in the ſight of God, than he that ſpares a right eye or a right hand; for <hi>there is no ſin that this one evil reſerved, will not draw him to, Luke</hi> 8.13. in the time of temptation he will fall away <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Herod,</hi> try him in his darling, and he will turn a perſecutor of that way that before he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and <hi>Judas</hi> in his covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93322:101"/>turn'd Devil and betray'd his Maſter.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When men fall often into the ſame ſin, ſee it in <hi>Sampſon</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> that the Lord lets them fall ſo fouly at the Laſt being inſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by carnal confidence ſo often; and <hi>Jonas</hi> was angry again, and again, and juſtified it, when a man makes a ſin his meat and drink, the comfort of his life comes in by it from day to day, it's a ſad ſign.</p>
            <p>Fourthly; with the more hardneſs of heart, and with the leſs relenting ſin is committed, and the longer he can lye in it unrepented of, as we ſee it in <hi>Judas,</hi> he was told of the evil and danger of it, it had been good for him if he never had been born, and yet he goes out and ſaith, What will you give me? and ſome good men as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> yet lay long in a way of ſinning; the ſooner a man riſeth after falls, and a mans heart ſmites him as <hi>Davids</hi> did, the more pure is that mans Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the ſight of God, to be paſt feeling, and for men to give themſelves up to uncleanneſs,
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.19.</note> it's
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:93322:101"/>a ſad ſign of a ſear'd Conſcience,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.2,</note> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, When a temptation takes ſpeedily with a man, <hi>John</hi> 13.27.30. Chriſt did give <hi>Judas</hi> a Sop, which was a ſignal to give Satan a farther poſſeſſion of him, and he follows the temptation; but after that he went immediately out, there was no more conſultation; ſo the ſooner alſo that motions to duty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with a man, the more pure his Conſcience is, when the Lord ſayes, ſeek you my face, the Soul preſently anſwers, thy face Lord will I ſeek, the ſpirit ſayes come, and the Bride ſayes come; and <hi>the ſooner motions to ſin take with a man, the more impure and defiled is his Conſcience, Pro.</hi> 7.23. He no ſooner ſaw a Harlot, but he went after her ſtraight way; their hearts are hot as an Oven, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The more a man plots iniquity, and dothdeliberate it before hand, makes pro viſion for the fleſh, the adulterer waits for the twy-light,
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.14.</note> and he doth lye in wait at his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours door, when men dig deep for wayes how to accompliſh that that is
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:93322:102"/>evil, the more men exerciſe their wits in ſin, and the more deviliſh wiſdom is in it to commit iniquity by counſell and advice, is the wiſdom of the fleſh, <hi>ingenioſe nequam;</hi> as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> men will deſtroy the juſt by cruelty, and yet deal wiſely, and <hi>Julian</hi> by clemency, yet deal wiſely, let them enjoy their liberty by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting them by liberty, and in peace deſtroy them, <hi>God abhors plotted wickedneſs,</hi> and ſurely God will bring it to nought and confound men by it.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, When men watch oppertunities of ſinning and be glad ofthem, and be ſorry for the loſs of them at any time, as <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> ſought oppertunity to betray Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Prov. 7.</note> and the Harlot is glad of the opportunity, <hi>The good man is gene fromhome, and has taken a Sum of moneywith him, and will not return till thetime appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> come let us take ourfill of Love; and <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Miſtreſs when none of the men of the houſe were within, and <hi>Judas</hi> when the Oyntment was poured out, he was
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93322:102"/>ſorry for the waſt, that he loſt ſuch an opportunity, and <hi>Gehazy</hi> my Maſter has let him go with all thoſe fine things, but as the Lord lives I will go and get ſomething of him, and what did he get but a foul diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Eightly, When much means are uſed to keep men from ſin and they avail not, but men do break through all, and will commit ſin, when men have been often admoniſhed, <hi>Pro.</hi> 29.1. and often afflicted,
<note place="margin">Pro. 29.1.</note> God will hedge up their way with thornes, and yet they will follow after their Lovers,
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2.6</note> 
               <hi>God doth take many courſes to make ſin difficult unto a man,</hi> a hedge of thornes, and yet the man follows after it ſtill;
<note place="margin">Pro. 13.19</note> 
               <hi>Balaam</hi> a man would have thought Gods forbidding him firſt, and then the difficulties that lay in his way ſhould have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him, and though he would ſtill be trying to diſpleaſe God, yet ſtill God held a hand upon his Conſcience, nevertheleſs <hi>Balaam</hi> ran greedily after the wayes of unrighteouſneſs, when men cannot endure to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; <hi>Aſa</hi> was a godly man, yet
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:93322:103"/>his Conſcience was in an evil frame, he could not bear a reproof; nay, when men wait and lay ſnares for him that reproves in the gate, &amp;c. It is a ſign of a ſeared Conſcience; &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, When men grow impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and ſhameleſs in evil, for there is a ſhame that doth keep men from ſome ſins, ſome kind of awe and reſpects before men,
<note place="margin">Gen. 15.16.</note> but there is a fullneſs of ſin, and impudency, and obſtinacy makes it up, when men have a Whores forehead that cannot bluſh, they are not aſhamed of ſin, nay, they glory in their ſhame, and ſpeak of it with rejoycing; <hi>pudet non eſſe impudentem,</hi> the unjuſt know no ſhame.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, When men are not affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, and not afraid of ſpiritual judgments, it's the higheſt and the greateſt wrath that can befall a man: <hi>vae illis ad quorum peccata connivet Deus.
<note place="margin">Luther.</note> Ephraim</hi> is joyned to Idols, Let him alone; why ſhould they be ſmiten any more? they will revolt more and more, I will not puniſh your daughters when they commit adultery ſaies the Lord; <hi>non parcit

<note place="margin">Auſt.</note> O ſervum illum beatum,
<note place="margin">Tertul.</note> cui deus dignatur iraſci:</hi> The laſt ſentence of the Church is <hi>Anathama Maranatha,</hi> and ſo it is here alſo. Now there is nothing the people of God are more affected with then ſpiritual judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; to be given up to a hard heart, to a blind mind, and a ſpirit of ſlumber, they are troubled at; nothing more wounds upon a mans eſtate, or his name, lyes not ſo heavy upon his ſpirit, nay he would chuſe all outward evils rather, this is a ſtrange and terrible work of God in judgment, pouring out upon a man a ſpirit of a deep ſleep, <hi>and for men not to be troubled, that they are not troubled, it is an argument of a very polluted Conſcience.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor. Durum eſt quod ſeipſum non exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bern.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Now to give ſome rules how a man ſhould do to keep a good Conſcience in all things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Set a high price upon a good Conſcience, as being the excellency of the man, which will bear up a man againſt all evils that men or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:93322:104"/>can do to him;
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.12.</note> ſays the Apoſtle this is our rejoycing, that in godly ſimplicity, we have had our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in the world, and 'tis this that gives a man boldneſs in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, if our hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem us not, we have boldneſs in his ſight, a man that has a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſhall lift up his face without ſpot even before God; <hi>a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience it is a continual feaſt,</hi> it cheers a man in the worſt times, and his Conſcience can never be freed from guilt, that is not (in deſire at leaſt) freed from defilement, for Chriſt came by water and by bloud, and upon our Conſciences he ſprinkles bloud, and ſprinkles upon them clean water alſo.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Come to the Laver, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent dayly, judg your ſelves dayly, and apply the blood of Chriſt, which can onely purge the Conſcience, and do it dayly, for the longer any ſin lyes upon the Conſcience, the more unclean that Conſcience is; it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired unto a Fountain that doth dayly work out the mud,
<note place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t. 12.15.</note> and doth not let it reſt there at all, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:93322:104"/>works againſt it, <hi>to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Conſcience, all ſin is as a mote in the eye, and a beam, he can have no quiet till it be out,</hi> but ſin in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſcience, it is not burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome though men add iniquity to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity, can eaſily ſlip into ſin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any remorſe, whereas we are not to give place to the Devil, no not one hour, <hi>Peter</hi> after he had ſin'd, ſtraightway he went out and wept bitterly, Oh! when any ſin lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Conſcience, be ſure that it will defile thee more; therefore make haſt, and work it out, this delay of purging the Conſcience, is an evil may be found in the beſt men, it coſt <hi>David</hi> broken bones, and great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, thefore we ſhould be the more careful to come to the Laver of regeneration.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Do not deſpiſe the checks of Conſcience, but mind that Light within you, when it reproves for fins, either of omiſſion, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, do not turn the deaf ear; <hi>Davids</hi> heart ſmote him, and he took notice of it, and Chriſt himſelf, my reins chaſten me to inſtruct me in the
<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.7.</note>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:93322:105"/>night ſeaſon, &amp;c. For let me tell you <hi>that any motion of a mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſlighted, it is thereby defiled,</hi> for it ſpeaks in the name of God, and not any word of God, nor any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of Conſcience, ſhould we paſs by without regard, for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is in the place of God in the man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Let it be your conſtant deſire, and your dayly exerciſe, to live honeſtly in all things according to that of the Apoſtle; <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18. And truly therein the goodneſs of a mans Conſcience is ſeen, and <hi>Acts</hi> 24.16. <hi>In this I exerciſe my ſelf to have always a Conſcience void of offence, toward God and toward men,</hi> Satan doth caſt defilement into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience dayly, and therefore <hi>there is nothing that a man ſhould be imployed in more, then to keep a good Conſcience dayly in all things;</hi> and truly it is the great ſhame of many, that will take upon them the name of Religion, yet are defective in this in a great meaſure, that it may be ſaid of them, they do not labour in all things to keep a good Conſcience.</p>
            <pb n="191" facs="tcp:93322:105"/>
            <p>Fiſthly, Take heed of ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſins, that above others do moſt defile the Conſcience, though indeed all ſins defile the Conſcience; but <hi>ſome ſins are of a more bewitching, and a more defiling nature then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> as,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Secret ſins will provoke God to give thee up to the judgment of a defiled Conſcience; as he did <hi>Judas,</hi> becauſe he was a Devil.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Idolatry, Take heed of hankering after that abomination, either to worſhip an Idol, a falſe god, or the true God in a falſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and it is this laſt that you are moſt in danger of; therefore let it not be ſaid of any of you, you know not what you worſhip; but be able to ſay, we know what we worſhip, and how we worſhip God, in ſpirit and truth, and do not ſet up mans poſt by Gods poſt; <hi>away with all traditious, and inventions of men, in the worſhip of God:</hi> If you would keep Gods preſence, obſerve his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; let all be done according to the pattern, to the Law, and to the Teſtament, &amp;c. Elſe God may in
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:93322:106"/>juſt judgment, ſend us ſtrong deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to believe lies; which I fear is like to befall many of this nation, who have not received the truth, in ths love of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Take heed of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Whoredome; <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.12. <hi>Whoredome, and Wine, and new Wine,
<note place="margin">Prov 2.19.</note> take away thy heart; none that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of Life, &amp;c.</hi> Flee fornication and be not drunk with Wine, there is a woe to the drunkards; &amp;c. Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge. <hi>Theſe ſins beſot men,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Be much in a ſecret judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your ſelves, and in a private examination,
<note place="margin">Hag. 1.7.</note> the Lord ſaith conſider your ways, and ſet your hearts upon them, and turn in upon your actions and overlook them again, bring them to the Light, prove your ſelves, and judge your ſelves, and do it often, there is a daily judicatory to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, <hi>a cultus conſcientiae,</hi> which a man ſhould be buſied about every day, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.7. <hi>Then all thoſe Virgins aroſe and trimmed their
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:93322:106"/>lamps;</hi> the wiſe as well as the fooliſh, &amp;c. <hi>Ego de terrenis negotiis ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter accipio. Calv.</hi> Whileſt men are in this World, there is a daily defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that will cleave unto them, <hi>a ſquallor,</hi> there will be ſomething out of order, that there muſt be a daily and a continual triming, the wiſe as well as the fooliſh Virgins muſt be found in it, and truely if a man neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects it but a while, and keeps not a conſtant courſe in it, a man ſhall find a ſtrange averſeneſs in his ſpirit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto all his life after; for <hi>the way to ſin's defilement, is mainly by inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs,</hi> a man is hardened by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of ſin, and walks with God at a venture; and truely if Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan brings a man to that once, he hath prevailed very farr, and will exceedingly defile the man.</p>
            <p>We have ſpoken of keeping a good Conſcience <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> towards God, let us now come to conſider alſo what it is for a man to keep a good Conſcience towards man; for both theſe muſt go together, he muſt keep a good Conſcience in all things, as was hinted formerly, and be holy
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:93322:107"/>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; for a dead fly ſpoils the whole Box of Oyntment, and a good Conſcience is like to the eye, it hates motes, and they diſquiet it as well as beams: <hi>It's an errour in the common ſort of men to think all Religion lyes in their juſt and upright carriage towards men,</hi> as the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees did, and to ſuch I ſay doth your righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the cribes and Phariſees, if not, you ſhall never enter into the Kingdom of God, &amp;c. Indeed there is a civil honeſty, a ſweet and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious carriage towards men, that is very lovely, and theſe are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>the worlds Saints,</hi> and indeed they have nothing amongſt them appears ſo pleaſing;
<note place="margin">Mar. 10.21.</note> Chriſt loved the young man, and yet peculiar Grace he had none; for he was under the reigning power of covetouſneſs, and therefore there was ſomething in him that was more general, for which Chriſt loved him, he had reſtraining grace, and a ſweet outward carriage; that even the ſpirit of God had wrought in him, <hi>habent &amp; filii con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubinarum ſua munera,</hi> &amp;c. and yet
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:93322:107"/>Chriſt ſaid to him, for all theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments one thing thou lackeſt, &amp;c. and if thou walk never ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly before men, that thou be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed the worlds Saint, and thou couldeſt bring a teſtimony of thy good behaviour from all the ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men of thy age, yet without an inward work of grace and regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a heart inlivened by a ſpirit of faith, ſo that all theſe works flow from union with Chriſt, and from a principle of love wrought in thee to God, truly all that thou doſt is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable to God, <hi>in non renatis non ſolum peccata ſed &amp; bona opera ſunt mortalia,</hi> for <hi>fides eſt caput bonorum operum,</hi> and if that be wanting, all of it is but nature improved, and new dreſſed, and ſo can never pleaſe God, <hi>ſemen naturae non conſurgit in fructum gratiae;</hi> for a mans duties do proceed from the ſame principles that his ſins do, and there muſt be a renewing in the ſpirit of his mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God accepts any ſervice of him.</p>
            <p>And there are ſome men do turn to <hi>the other extream,</hi> and they ſay <hi>that all obedience is mainly towards
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:93322:108"/>God,</hi> and therefore they are much in prayer and hearing, and run from Ordinance to Ordinance, and they do ſpeak much alſo of keeping a good Conſcience before God; but yet they are negligent and looſe in their carriages towards men, they are as cenſorious and unjuſt and deceitfull buſie-bodies in other mens matters, proud, boaſters, falſe accuſers, whiſperers, &amp;c. Yet theſe men would paſs for Saints, and think themſelves in the higheſt form of profeſſors: Now this is a <hi>ſure rule,</hi> a pure Conſcience though he cannot keep all the commandments of God, yet he has a reſpect unto them all, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. with a care to walk anſwerable unto them, and there is none that he doth wholly neglect, as the word in the Hebrew ſignifies that man therefore whoſe profeſſion for God is never ſo high, and talkes never ſo much of having a good heart to Gods word, and would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted in his religious duties even Angelical, he prays much, hears much, faſts much, &amp;c. Yet if he practiſe it not in his particular place,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:93322:108"/>in his relations, in his ſhop, in his dealings with a man, I ſhall ſtrongly ſuſpect that man of hallowneſs and hypocriſie; how ever he may tip his Tongue like a Saint, yet he may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be reckoned amongſt the ſinners, and ſuch are ſpots in our feaſts, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now, To ſtir you up to this Duty of keeping a good Conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, let me exhort you to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Take ſpecial care of the ſouls that are committed to your charge; parents have the ſouls of their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren committed to their charge, and Miniſters of their people, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and Maſters in their places alſo, and of the Talents that God has committed to your truſt in this World; <hi>next to your own Souls, are the Souls of others,</hi> the more any loves his wife, and child, and friend, &amp;c.

            <p>Fifthly, Take heed of the neglect

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:93322:111"/>when I might have reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had not my Policy given Laws to my Piety, and my deſire to ſet up my ſelf, hindred me from exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God: <hi>Phineas</hi> was zealous for God, and a covenant of peace was made with him: <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did reform profaneſs and the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred him in goodneſs, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now when men will not uſe their authority for God, but he is diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and the ſouls of men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and the needy are ſold for a pair of Shooes, and their poſſeſſors ſlay them, and think themſelves not guilty, and every man does what is good in his own ſight, and there is none to put them to ſhame, the the Lord will remove the Diadem, &amp;c. and caſt down the mighty from their ſeat, and will exalt the humble and lowly.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Keep a good Conſcience towards enemies,
<note place="margin">Job 3.129, 30.</note> it was a brave tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in <hi>Job, If I rejoyced at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of him that hated me, or lift up my ſelf when evil found him,</hi> &amp;c. and our Saviour bids us,

And if he will do ſo, he muſt do it immediately, as it Heaven, if he will ſhew forth the love of a God he muſt do it immediately, and therefore though God could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort a man exceedingly by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; yet they are to mean to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Gods Love, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9 1.

            <p>Thirdly, The wrath of God after this Life, ſhall he ſuch as paſſeth knowledge, and paſſeth fear; <hi>Who knows the power of thy wrath?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 90.11</note> Now there is no creature can fill the Soul, all the goodneſs that is in the creature, cannot ſatisfie the hope of man, and all the evil in the creature cannot ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the fears of man; there will ſtill be ſomething that will go beyond a mans knowledg, and that a mans fears will go beyond; and therefore we commonly ſay, men are more feard then hurt: But in Heaven as the ſoul will be ſatisfied beyond all the good of the creatures, and that beyond a mans hopes, for the Lord will come to be admired in his Saints.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:93322:118"/>though they have a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, yet this is not the great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter, and we do not read that they are executioners one of another, or that God doth uſe the miniſtry of the good Angels in the puniſhment of the evil, though the good Angels ſtrive with them for the preſervation of the Saints, now what Creature has power enough to torment the Devils? ſuch great and mighty Creatures as they are, ſurely it is nothing elſe but the wrath and indignation of the great God, which is the fire that is reſerved for the Devil and his Angels, to be made objects of, and lye under for ever, <hi>this the Lord doth ſuſpend here in this life by the Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi> becauſe now there is a time of patience, and the Lord has ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to imploy them in, as veſſels of diſhonour, which if they ſhould lye under the wrath of God perfectly poured out, they would not be able to perform, and therefore the Lord doth forbear them, that at laſt wrath may come upon them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Conſider the firſt fruits

I know God will never have mercy upon me, and therefore their ſoul chooſeth ſtrangling, any thing to put them out of this torment, what did <hi>Judas</hi> aiſe, who did hurt him? he had money in his purſe, there was no evil of the Creature upon him, he gratified the high Prieſts, and many of that crew, only there was a ſecret touch of Gods

And not only in wicked, but in godly men, as <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Heman, Job</hi> 6.4. <hi>The arrows of the Almighty ſtick in me, and the terrors of God do ſet themſelves in array againſt me,</hi> and ſurely inward terrors are the moſt terrible, and <hi>there are no medicines in the whole creation, that can heal a wounded ſpirit,</hi> all friends, eſtates, honours, relations, will be to a man as the white of an Egge, in the day when the terrors of Gods wrath do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs a man about, as if God ſpeak peace to the Soul, none can ſpeak terror, no not all the Creatures, and the moſt exquiſite miſeries that can be inflicted by them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:93322:122"/>'tis a righteous thing with God to recompence tribulation to every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, &amp;c. Now <hi>who is able to take an estimate of the evil that is in ſin, and the wrong that it has done unto God,</hi> there are two things in ſin, <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num &amp; injuria,</hi> a wrong in point of goods, and in point of honour, ſin has deſtroyed all the Creatures, who is able to value the loſs of a whole world, but only he that made it, and the loſs of a Soul, but he that purchaſed it, and who is able to judge of the glory of God, and the infinite wrong that is done him by ſin; no Creature in Heaven or in Earth can, and therefore if all the powers of the Creatures were put into one to torment a man but for one ſin, they were never able to give unto him the wages and the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of one ſin proportionable unto the wrong that God has ſuſteined thereby, either in point of goods or honour; for <hi>there is more evil in one ſin, then there is or can be good in any of the Creatures,</hi> therefore God muſt put his own Power, the power of his wrath unto the work, if he will
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:93322:122"/>have the wages of any one ſin payd: Judges here, do condemn men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and paſs the ſentence upon them, but they leave it unto others to execute them, becauſe they can do it as effectually as themſelves, but it is not ſo here, if God will have a ſinner pay the utmoſt farthing, he muſt exact it of him himſelf; for ſin is out of meaſure ſinful, it paſſeth the thoughts of Men and Angels to conceive, and therefore the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is greater then they can inflict; it is God alone can do it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If we reſpect the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject upon which this puniſhment is to light; That is chiefly to be puniſhed that has the chief hand in the ſin. Now, Sin is mainly the ſin of the Soul; <hi>Mic</hi> 6.7. <hi>Rom</hi> 6.16. Though the creature might puniſh the body, yet the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> torment is to be laid on the Soul, but the Soul is capable of more to recent, then all the creatures in Heaven and Earth can inflict; God only is the Father of Spirits, and the correction and diſcipline of Spirits do belong to him alone; we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſay, that the Devils in Hell,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:93322:123"/>ſhall be the tormenters of ſouls there, as if there work there, were only to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment men for ever, whereas they ſhall be chiefly tormented themſelves; for there is a Lake of fire and brimſtone prepared for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and yet you ſay he can torment the ſoul, being a ſpirit; but alaſs the torment muſt be deſtruction,
<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1.9.</note> from the preſence of the Lord, &amp;c. Now, all the devils in Hell could never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict any thing that ſhould diſtroy the ſoul, or take away all good from the ſoul, and fill it full of miſery; they can never ſatisfy the capacity of the Soul in good, nor in evil, the Soul is a veſſel of wrath, and will hold more then all the creatures can put into it, and will live it, 'tis only under the wrath of God that the Soul dyes, and therefore they that can kill the Body, they are not able to kill the Soul, <hi>God only can create,
<note place="margin">Mat. 10.28.</note> therefore God only can annihilate, therefore God only can inflict a puniſhment worſe then annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 26.24.</note> It had been good for that man he had not been born, that thus comes under the puniſhment of God, this is a dreadful confidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <pb n="227" facs="tcp:93322:123"/>
            <p>Secondly, It is an act fit for none but God, for it is, Firſt, An act of juſtice; 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5. In the day of Revelation of the righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, when God will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his juſtice to the utmoſt. Now, <hi>Who is able to ſhew forth the juſtice of God, in the extent and glory of it but himſelf?</hi> When God will manifeſt an attribute to the World, he doth it by himſelf immediately; if he would ſhew his Power; he will make a World; if he would ſhew his Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he gives his Son; and if his Glory, he makes Heaven; and if his Juſtice, he makes Hell. Now, As nothing can do the former but Gods immediate hand, ſo nothing can do the latter alſo, for to manifeſt an attribute, is an act and glory of God; for as none can ſhew forth his mercy, ſo none can ſhew forth and declare his Juſtice, but himſelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is an act of wrath; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.5.
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.5.</note> 
               <hi>But after thy hardneſs and impenitent heart, treaſureſt up wrath againſt the day of wrath:</hi> Now, no creature is able to ſhew forth the wrath of the great God, here there
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:93322:124"/>is a little wrath manifeſted in them, his wrath is kindled but a little,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 2. laſt.</note> &amp;c. And he corrects in meaſure, but when the Lord ſhall cauſe his whole wrath to ariſe, and puniſh man out of meaſure, that no creature is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of doing, no creature can pour out all the grace of God neither; and therefore God made choice of Chriſt who was God and man, to lay up all his treaſures of grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in, anſwerable to thoſe infinite thoughts of mercy and grace that were in himſelf; 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11. And this life is in his Son, and ſo no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can ſhew forth all Gods wrath, he muſt do it by himſelf.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It muſt be an act of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, which is the royalty of God, that he claims to himſelf, and he will not give unto any other; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.30. <hi>For we know him that has ſaid, vengeance belongs unto me, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence ſaith the Lord, and again, the Lord ſhall judge his people. It is a fearful thing, to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> He forbids pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate revenges, and ſaith to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, if he ſmite thee on the one
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:93322:124"/>cheek, turne the other, &amp;c. As <hi>there are none avenge here below, but Magiſtrates, his Vicegerents, to ſhew that it is the priviledg of none but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hereafter.</hi> Now, if he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it unto himſelf here, ſurely he will take it to himſelf hereafter; in the diſpoſing of the eternal eſtates of the greater part of the World, Angels and Men, to give this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour unto the creature that they ſhould take vengeance, the Lord will never do it, but it is and ſhall be an act of his own immediate wrath, and here the three perſons hath in Scripture, their <hi>opera appropriata,</hi> if the Father be provoked, the Son is an advocate with the Father, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt ſtrives with him, but when all the perſons ſhall joyn together, the Son will plead no more, and the ſpirit ſtrive no more, but all joyn in this great work of vengeance, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, as in Heaven, he ſhall be a ſpirit of Adoption, and Glory; ſo in Hell a ſpirit of bondage and torment for ever.

            <p>Thirdly, At the laſt and general judgment, Satan ſhall accuſe them being condemned together with him, he ſhall take them to Hell with him, for this wrath is prepared for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his Angels: But this kingdome of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>atan, ſhall laſt no longer then the kingdome of the Angels, and all rule, and all authority ſhall be put down, when Chriſt ſhall have given up the kingdome unto the Father, and the Angels ſhall rule over the elect no more; ſo the Devil ſhall rule over the reprobate no more; but now God ſhall be all in all: <hi>In Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:93322:126"/>he ſhall be all in all in mercy, and in Hell he ſhall be all in all in wrath,</hi> and there ſhall be no more any do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of one Creature over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>God will no more uſe one Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to reward another, or to puniſh another,</hi> but himſelf ſhall be all in all.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But in Heaven there be many created comforts, therefore in Hell there are many created miſeries, and therefore the wrath of God is not the only Executioner there, as you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's true there are many miſeries there from the Creatures, the place is a Dungeon of darkneſs, it is the bottomleſs pit, <hi>abiſſus</hi> the deep; as there is a great deal of ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the place in Heaven and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo there is much miſery here from the place; for there are Chambers of death.</p>
            <p>Secondly, From the Company; the friends of a Soul, and the enemies, and all reſtraining grace, and the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:93322:127"/>Law of nature ſhall ceaſe, and ſin ſhall be acted to the life, as part of a mans puniſhment, and they ſhall be ſet one againſt another for ever; <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves</hi> had torment by the coming of his brethren, the man ſhall be torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the coming of his wife, and his children, and his Companions here on earth, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, From the upbraidings of Satan; for his malice ſhall never ceaſe, and therefore he will in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect be ſhewing a man his folly, and endeavour to torment him more and more,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 21.14.</note> and will deride him, and there is nothing more bitter to a man then to be ſcorned in miſery and derided, and this men may look for in Hell at the hand of Satan, he will mock at them for ever, and never ſhew thee the leaſt pity; for thou art bound up amongſt the Tares, in the ſame bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the Devil and all his crew; thus indeed there are ſome created miſeries in Hell, but yet it is the wrath of God that is the great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that as in all created bleſſings here, it is his love that is the root, and the Fountain of them, and they
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:93322:127"/>are all nothing unleſs that go before, they all ſtand but for a Cypher; ſo unleſs his wrath go before, all theſe torments would be but Cyphers, and the Soul would live; there is no Creature that can kill the Soul, they may indeed kill the body, and a ſmall Creature can do ſo, if it be armed by God, and the greateſt can do no more then kill the body, <hi>as the life of the Soul comes from God only, ſo does the death of the Soul alſo;</hi> for he only is the father of ſpirits, and the Lord loves variety in his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over us, he will for a time govern by the Creatures, and comfort by the Creatures, and afflict by them, but hereafter he will then govern by himſelf immediately, and comfort and afflict by himſelf immediately, the one in this life, and the other in the life to come.</p>
            <p>Firſt,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
               </label> This informes us that there are certain men that are children of wrath, knowing the terror of the Lord we would perſwade you to fly from the wrath to come; for it is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:93322:128"/>the living God; Here firſt I will ſhew you who the perſons are that be the children of wrath; Secondly, what we would perſwade them to, if the Spirit of God joyn with us therein.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Who they are, and unto whom this uſe is directed, that there are ſome children of wrath is plain, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.6. <hi>The people of my wrath,</hi> that is, appointed to wrath, and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34.5. a ſword is bathed in Heaven; which doth expreſs the decree and purpoſe of wrath, it is upon the people of his curſe, now if this be true of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral wrath, how much more of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal wrath, which the Apoſtle ſaith is the condition of all men by nature, even of the elect of God, as well as of others, before they are converted; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. We by nature were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and children of wrath, now they are ſaid to be <hi>the children of it; becauſe they were born to it, and it is their inheritance,</hi> all that ever they muſt look for, men appointed to it, as a child of death is a man deſerving death, and appointed thereunto,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:93322:128"/>and as the Saints are called the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light; ſo are theſe alſo chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath; ſo if you would ask, for whom is this wrath, and who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of the word are under it? it is every man that is in a ſtate of nature, and a ſtate of unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraſy; But how ſhould a man know who it is that is in a ſtate of nature, ſurely a man may know if he will but behold his face in the Glaſs of the Word, and diſcerne <hi>what manner of perſon he is, James</hi> 1.24. There is a judgment that paſſeth upon the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtates of men in the Word of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.25.
<note place="margin">Ezek. 20</note> The man is judged of all, and the ſecrets of his heart are made manifeſt, and he ſaith that God is in you of a truth; a man look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Word, may diſcerne what his eſtate is: Now firſt, <hi>they are children of wrath that are children of diſobedience;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 3.6.</note> for theſe things the wrath of God comes upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience,
<note place="margin">John.</note> 
               <hi>He that is born of God ſinneth not, non operatur pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum,</hi> he that committeth ſin is the ſervant of ſin, and he that commits ſin is of the Devil, that is, that lives
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:93322:129"/>and lyes in any known way of ſinning; that he doth reſerve unto himſelf a ſweet Morſell, that he cannot caſt out, that the comfort of his life comes in by, he eats the bread of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and drinks the Wine of violence, he feeds upon huskes, and upon aſhes,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 44.20.</note> over whom ſin has dominion; and it reigns in their mortal body; and they obey it in the luſt thereof, and take care to make proviſion for't, thou art yet in my ſins; and not only ſins of commiſſion but ſins of omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for ſuch alſo this fire is prepared, <hi>Depart from me you curſed into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting fire,
<note place="margin">Mat. 25</note> prepared for the Devil an his Angels; for I was hungry and ye gave me no meat; it is not you took away my meat, and naked, and ye robbed me of my cloathing; I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you and ye put me into priſon; but ye did not viſit me, and Miniſter unto me,</hi> &amp;c. So that even ſins of omiſſion alſo prove an unregenerate ſtate, and will make a man lyable unto this wrath at the coming of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The wrath of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from Heaven againſt all ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:93322:129"/>and unrighteouſneſs of men,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> who withhold the truthin unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> When men are convinced that ſuch things are duties, and will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them, and that ſuch things are ſins, and yet for ſome worldly ends, and baſe reſpects will not forbear to practiſe them, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Phariſees were convinced that Chriſt was the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and yet for fear of the <hi>Jews</hi> durſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs him,
<note place="margin">Joh. 12.42</note> that go on in ſin againſt their own light and convictions from day to day, and againſt many warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and admoniſſions, and his own remembrances of the dealings of God both with himſelf and others, that have been engaged in ſinfull courſes; and truly this fire will not burn hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon any ſort of ſinners in the world, then they that ſin againſt light, and in this manner do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the truth in unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>They are asted by no other ſpirit but the ſpirit of this world;</hi> for there is a double ſpirit that men are acted by in all their actions, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God acts ſome men, and the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:93322:130"/>ſpirit of the world acts others; they that are regenerate have received the Spirit of Chriſt, and where the ſpirit of Chriſt is, there are all the fruits of the Spirit, and the inward man is in ſome meaſure conformed unto Chriſt, whereas other men are acted by no other rules but the cuſtom of the world, for worldly ends, that look no higher then the things of this life, and the things that are ſeen, whereas a man that is regenerate has received another ſpirit that acts him by another rule; for he is led by the Spirit, and unto a higher end, he looks upon the things that are not ſeen.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.</note> 
               <hi>In this are the children of God manifeſt and the children of the Devil,</hi> he that doth not righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not of God, and he that loves not his brother, verſe the 14. We know that we are tranſlated from death to life, becauſe we love the brethren, now when a mans heart is imbittered againſt the Saints of the moſt high, he doth wiſh evil to them, and if any evil doth befall them he rejoyceth, and at leaſt if he can do
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:93322:130"/>no more he will inwardly pleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that they are brought low, it's an argument that thou art one of the Serpents ſeed, and thy envy is both thy ſin and thy Plague, as it is the Devils, I will put enmity ſayes God between the ſeed of the Serpent and the ſeed of the Woman, <hi>the enmity is put into the Devils Curſe,</hi> and if thou didſt love him that did beget, thou wouldſt love them that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of him, and thou that doſt hate the Image of God whereſoever it is, and the more thou doſt ſee of the Image of God in the man, the more thou doſt hate him, as Chriſt ſaid of the Phariſees, <hi>which of you can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me of ſin? I heve done many good works amongſt you, for which of them do you ſtone me?</hi> ſo the people of God may ſay, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not accuſe them but for the good that they have done you; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they are, they are as dew upon the Graſs, thou ſhalt be a bleſſing, only men hate the image of God in them, as it's ſaid of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, animal hominibus inimiciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> it doth ſo hate a man that it
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:93322:131"/>will fly at the picture of a man; ſo it is but a little relemblance of God that is in the beſt of the Saints here in this life, and yet men hate God ſo, that they cannot endure his image in any man,
<note place="margin">Tert.</note> 
               <hi>Bonus vir Caius ſeius, ſed ideo malus, quia Chriſtianus.</hi> This ſhews that thou art an unregenerate man, a child of the Devil, and not new born unto God: Now, thou art a child of wrath, and for thee is this eternal fire prepared.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Mark 3.7.</note> I would exhort you all to flee from the wrath to come, it is the greateſt evil that can befall a ſoul; and therefore that which above all things elſe a man ſhould fly from: <hi>Fuga,</hi> is converſant only about that which is evil, and that which a man apprehends to be ſo. Now, the greater the evil is, the more haſty is the flight: Now, <hi>There is no evil like to that of the wrath to come;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let the whole ſoul be put out in this, to fly from it, as the moſt dreadful deſtruction that can befall a ſoul. Firſt, Conſider there is a poſſibility to eſcape it, truly it is in vain to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort a man to fly from that which he
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:93322:131"/>cannot ſcape, as it is a vain thing for men to think to fly from death or judgment, that they cannot eſcape, it will overtake them; and ſo for them to think to fly from any threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening in the word of God, if they do continue in their ſins, it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly overtake them; Did not my word overtake your Fathers ſays the Lord? But this wrath a man may ſo fly from as to eſcape, for Chriſt wins ſouls from the kingdom of Satan every day, he tranſlates them out of the kingdome of Satan, which is the kingdom of darkneſs, into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his dear Son; and it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is a metaphor taken from tranſlating a man from his native ſoil, tranſlating a man, as you do Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and ſo many are tranſlated day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and they paſs from death to life; Oh! That the Lord would perſwade you knowing the terrour of the Lord, to fly from the wrath to come; Chriſts is a kingly conqueſt, and he has not a ſubject in his kingdome; but he has won him from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Satan, and all that number that are called, and choſen, and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:93322:132"/>faithful that are with the Lamb, were all once in Satans kingdome, and all the Saints that are or ſhall be in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they were all of them children of wrath as well as thou, even <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> the Father of the faithful, who together with his Father <hi>Terah,</hi> and <hi>Nachor</hi> and his brother <hi>Lot,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joſh 24.23.</note> all ſerved other Gods beyond the River, only God called this righteous man to his foot; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.2. And therefore there is as great a poſſibility for thee to eſcape this wrath, as there is for any man in the World; therefore fly from it, <hi>Satan never wins again any one Soul out of the kingdome of Chriſt,</hi> for the Father that gave them to Chriſt, is ſtronger then all, and no man can pluck them out of his hands, and he doth now win ground of the kingdome of Satan, and gains ſouls from him every day; indeed <hi>after this life Heaven and Hell ſha divide the World,</hi> and there is a gulph ſet, there is no changing places; if a man would come from Hell to Heaven he cannot, for a mans eternal ſtate is caſt, and there is no change of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eternity; and therefore the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:93322:132"/>paſſed upon a man at the laſt day is called eternal judgment,
<note place="margin">Heb. 6.2.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the doom and ſentence that ſhall be paſſed upon a man there, is for eternity; and therefore make haſt, fly from the wrath to come, delay not the time, for that haſtens, for if death ſhould overtake thee before thou haſt made this eſcape, thou wilt be a child of wrath, and lye under wrath for ever; but here there is no gulf ſet, but there may be a tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider, that after this Life you ſhall have to do with God immediately, you ſhall fall into the hands of the living God immediately, and Gods workings by the creatures ſhall have an end. Now, we find what fearful effects of wrath have been brought forth, if God do but arme the creatures againſt a man; if the Lord do but cauſe Lice to ſeiſe upon <hi>Herod,</hi> they devour him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and he gives up the ghoſt; and if the Lord give a man up into the power of Satan, to torment him at his pleaſure; and we ſee how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand miſeries he would bring
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:93322:133"/>upon him, as we ſee in his dealing with <hi>Job,</hi> when yet the Lord gives him only a power over the body and eſtate, not over his ſoul and his life; and yet, How did he lay a load upon him? That his life was a burden to him, and he chuſed to dye rather. Now if God can ſhew forth ſo much wrath by a creature, how much more by his own immediate hand? And if God in the creatures, now, do chaſtiſe with Rods, by his own hand, he will then do it with Scorpions; <hi>His little finger will be heavier, than the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures loins;</hi> for as a man cannot know Love by all that is before him, becauſe all the creatures cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the Love of God unto the ſoul as it is; ſo a man cannot know ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by all that is before him, for all the creatures together cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence unto a man, the whole diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, that is Gods own work, therefore fly from it; if we ſhould fly from it in the ſtream, much more in the fountain.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is done by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and therefore it muſt needs be dreadful; for <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.31.41.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:93322:133"/>He has ſaid vengeance is mine, and I will repay; there ſhall be a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward to every ſinner:
<note place="margin">Heb. 2.1.3</note> Now, if we conſider what a wrong ſin is, it is ſuch an infinite evil, that all the created comforts, and good things of this life cannot make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for, they being only created good things; but ſin is an act com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt an infinite and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created Good, and <hi>between created, and uncreated, finite, and infinite, is no proportion: Rom.</hi> 7.13. Sin is out of meaſure ſinful, and therefore the wrath of God is out of meaſure dreadful, for it muſt be a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge a full recompence: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.6.7. <hi>He will puniſh his people in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but he will puniſh his enemies without meaſure,</hi> becauſe it is done in juſtice, therefore he will ſuffer his whole diſpleaſure to ariſe. Now, if it be ſo fearful a thing when the Lord lets out but a little of his wrath, if his wrath be kindled but a little? How much more when he doth ſtir up all his wrath? and deals with men by fury poured out.</p>
            <pb n="248" facs="tcp:93322:134"/>
            <p>Fourthly, The ſubject upon which this wrath ſhall light, ſhall be the Souls of men, but eſpecially a mans Conſcience which is the tendereſt part, even the eye of the Soul, and the Soul of man is capable of wrath beyond what all the Creatures in Heaven and Earth can inflict, there is not enough in this world to fill the ſences of man,
<note place="margin">Eccle. 1.8.</note> the eye is not ſatisfied with ſeeing, nor the ear with hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for there is nothing beneath God will ſatisfie it,
<note place="margin">Pſ. 17. laſt.</note> but as in Heaven the Soul ſhall be ſatisfied and fill'd with his love; ſo in Hell it ſhall be ſatisfied and fill'd with his wrath, and <hi>it's this filling the Soul with miſery that is properly the death of the Soul,</hi> and therefore Chriſt ſaith that the Creatures can but kill the body, and there is no more that they can do, they cannot kill the Soul, becauſe they cannot fill it neither with good things nor with evil; <hi>as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the glory of God can make a man perfectly and fully happy, ſo there is nothing but the wrath of God that can make a man fully and perfectly miſerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="249" facs="tcp:93322:134"/>
            <p>Fifthly,
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.5.</note> It is wrath by long pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence treaſured up; the patience and goodneſs of God ſhould lead to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which a man deſpiſing, treaſures up wrath againſt the day of wrath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Lord doth bear long, and becauſe ſentence againſt evil workers is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the hearts of men are fully ſet in them to do evil, and therefore they mock at the coming of the Lord to take vengeance,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3 3.</note> where is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his coming? he is preſſed under their abominations as a Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of ſheaves, and yet he bears ſtill, and lets men deſpiſe his goodneſs, fill up their meaſure, and out-ſtand the day of his patience, which has its Period, and then <hi>caeſa patientia fit furor,</hi> if once he doth whet his glittering Sword, and his hand take hold of judgement, a fire is kindled in his anger, that will burn for ever, and the more his patience and goodneſs has been deſpiſed, the greater treaſure of wrath is laid up, and the more will be brought forth at the day of payment; for it muſt be a juſt recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</p>
            <pb n="250" facs="tcp:93322:135"/>
            <p>Sixthly, This wrath doth come upon men very ſuddenly and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, 'tis ſudden deſtruction, ſwift damnation,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.1.</note> though a man may have gone on and proſpered in a way of ſinning long, but yet a hand of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance will overtake them, as the ſwelling in a great wall that comes ſuddenly down, wrath has hung over a man a long time, the decree has travelled with judgement long, but it comes ſuddenly, as the travel of a woman; God feeds them as ſheep in a large Paſture, and then brings them forth to the ſlaughter,
<note place="margin">Rev. 14.18, 19.</note> 
               <hi>there is a fatting time, and there is a killing time, there is a ripening time, and a reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,</hi> gather the Grapes, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Wine-preſs; for her Grapes are fully ripe, thruſt in the Sicle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Angel thruſt in his Sicle, and caſt it into the great Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs of the wrath of God, and that comes upon men ſuddenly, when they expect it not, and they are enſnared and taken, and it will come unavoidably, there is no way to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape it, when the day of vengeance is come, though men have ſcaped it
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:93322:135"/>before, but now all the power of the Creaturts cannot relieve a man, <hi>Neh.</hi> 1.10. But though they be ſolded as thorns, yet they ſhall be devoured as ſtubble that cannot reſiſt the fire, as the duſt to the Beeſom,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 14.24.</note> ſo will the Lord ſweep them to deſtruction in his wrath, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.10. They pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh at the rebuke of thy Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, look when God will caſt a man into deſtruction, that man will become a humble petitioner, to the Mountains to fall upon him, and hide him from the wrath of him that is upon the Throne and from the Lamb.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It ſhall be pure wrath, judgment without mercy, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.10. <hi>They ſhall drink of the Wine of the wrath of God without mixture;</hi> for there ſhall be utter darkneſs, that is, <hi>purae tenehrae,</hi> and it ſhall be inflicted upon them with delight, the Lord ſaith, I will eaſe me of my adverſaries, and he will laugh at your calamity, <hi>(ſmiling wrath is dreadfull)</hi> and his ſpirit ſhall be quieted thereby, <hi>Zach.</hi> 6.8. a judge here though he condemn the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:93322:136"/>malefactour, yet he pities the man, but the Lord will laugh at him, they that are children of wrath are a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of a ſweet ſavour to God.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay; What ſhould we do to eſcape it?
<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1.10.</note> There is no way but Chriſt, to diliver us from the wrath to come, and there is no way but by being one with him, and that is,</p>
            <p>Firſt, By being cut off from the old root,
<note place="margin">Rom, 11.24.

            <p>Secondly, Upon this, there is a diſcovery made of Chriſt unto the ſoul, that there is redemption in him to be had, that we periſh not; and that he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, thoſe that come unto him: And all this is but the fruits of the ancient agreement between
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:93322:136"/>Chriſt and the Father, God was in Chriſt reconciling the World, <hi>God did love to have is ſo;</hi> and this is ſeeing the Son: <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.36.

<note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> he looks at that in all ordinances, in which he is converſant, to win Chriſt is his only aim, and he will not be bribed with any other thing, as a falſe ſpirit will be; if he have gifts and ſome raiſedneſs in parts, and qualifications, and a name to live among men he is ſatisfied, and Conſcience is very quiet, but a ſoul that has received this magnetick touch from the ſpirit, is put off with nothing beſides Chriſt, it moves to him as naturally, as the ſtone unto its center.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He accepts of Chriſt upon his own terms, gives up it ſelf to him; Receives Chriſt with all

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:93322:139"/>had been to them ſo ſweet in the mouth, become now gravel in the belly? If as it was with <hi>Belte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazer,</hi> in the middle of all his jollity, ſuch an impreſſion be ſet on as <hi>Mene Tekel;</hi> Would it not make his heart and loins to tremble?

            <p>Secondly, They think the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God to be very miſerable men and women, becauſe they are afflicted in this life, and there way is hedged up with thornes, that they
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:93322:140"/>cannot find their paths, and they have not that freedom in ſinning that they have; cannot run to acceſs of riot, &amp;c. Whereas, if men did believe that there were wrath which God reſerves for the workers of iniquity, they would count it <hi>the greateſt mercy in the World, to be diſappointed in a way of ſinning, and the greateſt plague to be ſinners; Prov.</hi> 14.15. <hi>The backſlider in heart ſhall be filled with his own ways:</hi> God will give him over that he ſhall ſin enough, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in this World God doth in a ſpecial manner afflict his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when the wicked come into no misfortune; but they have more then heart can wiſh, waters of a full cup are wrung out unto them: Now they count this their happineſs, and the other the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of the ſaints of God; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. When we are judged, we are chaſtened of the Lord, that me might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the World; God doth it to deliver their ſouls from going down into the pit. Now,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:93322:140"/>
               <hi>That's a happy man whom the Lord will not ſuffer to periſh.</hi> And they know that there is a fatting time, and a killing time, and that the Lord will bring other men forth as ſheep to the ſlaughter. And that they are men not appointed unto wrath, and in that they rejoyce, whereas there is wrath reſerved for them to eternity, who are the men who have had their good things in this Life, and have fared deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly every day.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Men fear it not, and it doth not in the conſideration of it, imbitter either the pleaſures or the proffits of ſin, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the creatures unto them, which as ſoon as ever theſe ſerious thoughts do feiſe upon other men, that have another ſpirit, it will quickly do; and therefore men do put far from them the evil day, and when the greateſt judgments of God are threatned, they ſay, he propheſieth of things long to come, it is of dooms-day that the Prophet ſpeaks, the wrath of a King, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, is as a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:93322:141"/>of death, but ſo is not the wrath of the great God, who is a conſuming fire: <q>There is a ſtory of a certain Chriſtian King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> Who was exceeding ſad and penſive, and had a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a wild-Courtier, who comes in merrily and asked him why he was ſo melancholly, he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, that he had been a great ſinner before the Lord, and he knew not how to appear before him when he ſhould come to judgment; but the young Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant made light of it, and that night his Brother the King, ſent an executioner to ſound a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet at his door, which was the the manner in thoſe Countries, to do to men that were to be led forth to execution; at this the young man that was ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and regardleſs of the wrath of God, yet he haſtned into his brothers preſence, with a great deal of fear and amazement of ſpirit, to know wherein he had offended, that he was ſummoned by the executioner; to whom
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:93322:141"/>his Brother anſwered, if to me that am your Brother, and one whom your Conſcience tells you you have not wronged, How much ſhould I be afflicted that am to come before a God?

            <p>Now, If the Lord will pleaſe to come in and perſwade your hearts to believe it, take theſe arguments and conſider them ſeriouſly.</p>

            </p>
            <pb n="266" facs="tcp:93322:143"/>
            <p>Fourthly, Conſider whether or no thou haſt never had any of the firſt fruits of it, God letting in a glimpſe of his wrath upon thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſome grudgings of that burning-feaver, that thou ſhalt lye under for ever; there are unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men that have a taſte of the powers of the world to come,
<note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> by powers are meant powerful and mighty workings upon the ſpirits of men, by the ſpirit of God, and how mightily theſe apprehenſions do work upon men, either of the joys of Heaven, or of the torments of Hell, men receiving a pledg and an earneſt in themſelves before hand; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.27. Receiving a ſentence of condemnation in their own ſouls, the wrath of God has a venome in it, and it drinks up their ſpirits, and the Lord comes upon them as a Lyon, and breaks all their bones; that <hi>though they Love ſin never ſo dearly, yet they can take no delight in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, It will appear in the Lord Chriſt, Why did he come from Heaven, and take the nature
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:93322:143"/>of man upon him? The great end was not <hi>legem docere,
<note place="margin">Luth.</note> &amp; miracula facere;</hi> for this others did as well as he, though from him and by his ſpirit; but it was <hi>legem vincere &amp; abolere, Gal.</hi> 4.4. He was made under a Covenant of works, and that for two things. Firſt, That he might pay the debt that was due by us to God. Secondly, That he might cancel the bond. Now he was made a curſe for us, and therefore the Lord did cauſe all our ſins in the guilt and the puniſhment of them to meet upon him,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 110. laſt.</note> he drank off the brook in the way, &amp;c. Then all that are under the Law, ſtill they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the curſe of it, and all their ſins in the guilt and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, will meet upon them as the ſins of the elect did upon the Lord Chriſt, for <hi>Chriſt is but the ſurety of the elect,</hi> and he did it voluntarily in obedience to the Father, and therefore ſurely thou being the principal canſt not look to ſcape, for thou ſtandeſt under the ſame covenant, and under the ſame
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:93322:144"/>curſe; indeed unto them that are regenerate, the Covenant is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed, he has blotted it out, and nailed it to his Croſs, and he only ſtands under a Covenant of works for them, and by the aboliſhing this, has made way for a ſecond Covenant; but to all that are unregenerate, the Covenant ſtands in force and they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it and under the curſe of it for ever.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If you would indeed ſcape the wrath to come, <hi>bring forth fruits meet for repentance; Mat.</hi> 3.8. When they did pretend to deſire to fly from the wrath to come, <hi>John</hi> bid them make it appear to be true, by bringing forth anſwerable fruits meet for repentance; <hi>in this life God in judgment, doth put no difference between men and men;</hi> but pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and impenitent ſickneſs doth not complement with the great men of the World, but aſſaults them boldly, as well as the meaneſt; and death knocks at the door of the Prince, as well
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:93322:144"/>as of the pooreſt man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſurely it will be ſo in his eternal judgment alſo; and thefore ſee you be penitent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For unleſs you repent you ſhall all periſh: But how ſhall a man know he is penitent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, When a mans heart is truly turned againſt that ſin that he has repented of; for this is the miſery <hi>novum hoc monſtri ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus est eadem poena omnes jugiter faciunt quae ſe feciſſe plangunt,</hi> when a man hates every falſe way, hatred is againſt all ſin univerſally, but in eſpecial manner againſt the darling ſin, that ſin in which a man has moſt diſhonour'd God and wounded his own Conſcience, and by which Satan as a Proper has moſt tyranized over him, what have I to do any more with Idols?

               </note> a mans unrightneſs of heart is ſeen in this that he keeps himſelf from his own iniquity, there was but one way of dalliance that I did delight in, and yet I am willing to give that up alſo; as the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperour that had but one beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:93322:145"/>Concubine in which he much delighted and doted upon, that the <hi>Baſhaws</hi> and the <hi>Janizaries</hi> took it amiſs that he neglected the affairs of the Kingdom for her, he brought her forth before them one day in all her bravery and they all admired the beauty of the woman, and when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended her highly for all her good qualities, he cut off her head in their preſence, and told them he did it to let them ſee that there was nothing dear to him in reſpect of the publick welfare, it was an act of cruelty in him, but the moral of it may be of good uſe unto us; that is fruit worthy of repentance when a mans heart is moſt of all turn'd againſt his darling ſin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There will be a holy jealouſie of a mans ſelf, and a continual watching over the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man <hi>Pro.</hi> 4.23. Keep thy heart above all keeping, he hath a godly fear continually of the falſeneſs of his own heart, he knew that he is bent to backſliding,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:93322:145"/>and therefore is always watchfull, he will not truſt his eyes without a Couenant nor his tongue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a bridle; will not venture upon occaſions of ſinning, and will not be dallying with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leaſt a ſpark be ſtruck and the fire kindle again, leaſt he ſhould look back with <hi>Lots</hi> Wife, and with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> have a mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to hanker after <hi>Egypt;</hi> for <hi>if the love of the ſin doth ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in his inward man,</hi> there may be a reſtraint for a while and a damp, but <hi>it will break out again</hi> and the man will return with the dog to the vomit, the unclean ſpirit will enter again, and the man will be worſe then ever in the beginning; it is this only that is fruit worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, he is more afraid of ſin, then of any loſs of outward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in the world,

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, there will be an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable obedience, there is a double change in repentance, and therefore it has a double name, there is a <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:93322:146"/>before an oppreſſour, and now a reſtorer, and <hi>Saul</hi> a perſecutor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Gods people, diſturbing them in their way of worſhiping God, hailing them to priſon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to the death of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr <hi>Stephen,</hi> I but now <hi>Paul</hi> is a choſen veſſel unto the Lord, now he is a Preacher, and <hi>he did not more thirſt for the blood of Souls before, then now he doth for their Salvation;</hi> ſo a truly peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſoul, if he has been proud before his Converſion, he is cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with humility, if he was before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean he now putson chaſtity, and his care is that the contrary grace may grow and flouriſh in him, or elſe truly here are no fruits meet for repentance, and then what ever a man ſeems to be in the world, he is no true Saint, he does but ſeem to fly from the wrath to come, and all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion will come to nothing, 'tis but a ſhew, a fancy and nomore</p>
            <p>Now I come to the laſt Branch in the text, and that is <hi>the eternity of both theſe;</hi> where the Worm
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:93322:147"/>dyes not and the fire is not quenched,</p>
            <p>The Torment that the Lord has prepared for his Enemies is eternal. There are in the Eternity of God three things; firſt, it hath no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of its being or working; Secondly, it has no end; Thirdly, it has no ſucceſſion, his name is I am,
<note place="margin">Exod. 3 14</note> that I am; for <hi>in aeternitate non eſt erit &amp; fuit,</hi> we muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed deſtinguiſh between the act as it is in God, and the product thereof as it is in the Creature; all actions from God are from Eternity, and without ſucceſſion he underſtands all at once, but he doth will that the things ſhall in their being have a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and exiſt one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their ſeveral ſeaſons and Generations, as Creation in God is but one ſimple act of his will, and <hi>tota ſimul,</hi> it being nothing elſe but <hi>ipſa eſſentia dei cum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latione ad Creaturas, Aquin.</hi> p. 1.9.43. But he doth will that the Creatures in the ſpace of Six days ſhoul take their beginning, and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:93322:147"/>that after the creation, the floud ſhould come upon the world, and he did will from eternity, that all the creatures ſhould ſubſiſt and ſtand up out of nothing, in their ſeveral ſeaſons and order, which though it take place in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in ſeveral ages, yet it is all one eternal conſent, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will of God, ſome actions of God are <hi>ex neceſſitate naturae natae,</hi> and they take place from eternity, and have no beginning as the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the Son, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Holy-Ghoſt; but ſome are voluntary, and they have there beginning in time, as the will of God doth appoint them for to have.</p>
            <p>Now, Of two of thoſe branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of eternity, the creature is not capable, it cannot <hi>competere</hi> to a created nature.</p>
            <p>Firſt, All creatures muſt have a beginning, and cannot be eternal becauſe they have their being from another, and are not the fountain of their own being.</p>
            <pb n="276" facs="tcp:93322:148"/>
            <p>Secondly, All creatures have a ſucceſſion, either in their being, or their actions, they do one thing after another, and they may be ſaid to be, what they were not before, and to do what they did not before; but it cannot be ſo of God, and therefore he is only ſaid to inhabit eternity: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. It is his dwelling place alone, <hi>He that is every where preſent and fils all places without motion, he doth inhabit and fill all time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſſion.</hi> The Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though I do not ſay that their actions are meaſured by time as ours are, yet there is a ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them, and they do one thing after another, and as they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from one place to another, ſo they are meaſured in their act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, there is a ſucceſſion and they may be ſaid to have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing paſt, and ſomething to come; ſo there ſhall be in the thoughts of men, in Heaven and in Hell alſo, <hi>for they cannot take in eternity at once,</hi> they muſt act in a ſucceſſive way ſutable
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:93322:148"/>to the nature of a creature: But in the eternity of the creature there is only the laſt, it ſhall be without end, and without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; ſo that there are two things implyed in theſe laſt words <hi>the Worm dies not;</hi> it ſhall be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual, and it ſhall be eternal, there ſhall be no intermiſſion, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion: Here in this Life, either a mans choiceſt pleaſures have an end, or are interrupted. Son re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that in thy Life time thou receivedſt thy good things, and the conſideration thereof doth fill a mans Soul with Gall and Wormwood, in the ſweeteſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, and they all deceive a man as a brook that paſſeth by, and are as graſs upon the Houſe-top, that withers before it come to ripeneſs, either in the bud or in the blade it is blaſted, as all earthly comforts are ſo, for all fleſh is graſs, and the glory of it is as the flower of the field; or if they have not an end, they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptions,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:93322:149"/>and intermiſſions; a ſoul that injoys the light of Gods countenance, and has his heart filled with joy, more then can be had in corn and wine and oil, yet by and by God hides his face, and the man walks in darkneſs, and hath no lights again; and therefore he crie out with <hi>Bern.</hi> it is <hi>dulce com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercium,</hi> but <hi>breve momentum O ſi duraret,</hi> &amp;c. But after this Life in Heaven as we ſhall be ever with the Lord, ſo we ſhall always behold his face, and be ſatisfied with his likeneſs, and drink for ever out of the Rivers of his pleaſures, and this ſhall be without intermiſſion, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption for ever. And in this Life a mans greateſt affliction has an end alſo, <hi>Lazarus</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, when <hi>Dives</hi> is torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; in the grave the wicked ceaſe from troubling him, and the weary are at reſt, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners reſt together, they hear not the voice of the oppreſſont,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:93322:149"/>or at leaſt there is ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and there are lucid intervals, though heavineſs may indure for a night, yet joy will come in the morning; but after this life there will be no more changes; and therefore death is called by way of eminence a mans change; <hi>Job</hi> 14.14. <hi>All the days of my appointed time, will I wait till my change come;</hi> &amp;c. Becauſe it is a mans laſt and great change, though his life be full of changes, yet <hi>his death is the great and the laſt change;</hi> and there will be no more changes, a mans miſery will then be eternal without concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and continual without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. There will be pure dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, utter and everlaſting dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there will be no end, no mittigation, the Worm <hi>never</hi> dies, and <hi>never</hi> ſleeps, and the fire is <hi>never</hi> extinguiſhed, <hi>never</hi> abated or mittigated to eternity.</p>
            <p>Of theſe two I would ſpeak <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſtinctly; Firſt, Of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:93322:150"/>of Hell, that they are eternal and without concluſion. Secondly, that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual and without intermiſſion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The torments of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men after this life ſhall be eternal, and ſhall never end. We have heard that there are two parts of this torment, the one principal, <hi>the fire;</hi> and the other accidental, <hi>the Worm,</hi> and now we come to prove the eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of both theſe</p>
            <p>Firſt, The fire in Hell, that is, the wrath of God poured out upon the Soul ſhall be for ever, and ſhall never end, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>everlaſting</hi> fire, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.8. and 25.41. And <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting</hi> puniſhment, 25.46. And <hi>everlaſting</hi> deſtruction, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.9. And the Chains by which men are bound in the world to come, are <hi>everlaſting</hi> Chains under darkneſs,
<note place="margin">Luke 16.9.</note> 
               <hi>Jude</hi> 7. Heaven is an <hi>everlaſting</hi> habitation, and ſo is Hell alſo, it is for Eternity.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral expreſſions
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:93322:150"/>in Scripture that do argue as much; firſt, the Scripture doth tell us that there is a day of Grace and a time of patience, when the Lord will offer himſelf unto men, and wait upon them or their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of his Grace, but this day will have an end, and the time of buying will be paſt, and therefore it was not <hi>admonitio ſed exprobratio, non conſilium ſed oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium,</hi> &amp;c. It's not counſell but a ſcoffe, to go buy when the time of buying was paſt; there is now a time of mercy, but there is a time when the door will be paſt opening,
<note place="margin">Mat. 25.10. Eccl. 9.20.</note> and all mercy will be ſhut out for ever; there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdom in the Grave whither thou goeſt: <hi>The day of Grace has an end, but the day of wrath will never end;</hi> the days of Grace may be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, but the days of wrath ſhall be numberleſs; for the Scripture doth ſay that if the day of Grace be once over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:93322:151"/>it will never return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>Secondly, An ungodly mans hope is ſaid in Scripture to dye with him,
<note place="margin">Job 11.20.</note> his hope is as the giving up of the Ghoſt, <hi>He breaths out his laſt hope and his laſt breath together;</hi> for when a wicked man dyes his hope pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes,
<note place="margin">Pro. 11.7.</note> but the Righteous has hope in his death, his hope is a living hope, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it dyes not with his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Now how comes it to paſs a mans hope periſhes? this is grounded upon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity that is to come; for were there not an eternity, a mans hope would live, but at a mans death, a wicked mans eternal ſtate being caſt his hope dyes, becauſe there can be no expectation of a change: in all afflictions here there is hope of an end, or ſome mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<note place="margin">Zac. 9.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> they are all priſoners of hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Lord ſhall ſay to them in that day, <hi>Turn
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:93322:151"/>you to the ſtrong hold,</hi> &amp;c. but in Hell there is no hope of any other ſtate, no not for one moment but the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment continues to eternity.
<note place="margin">Rev. 20.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hell is called a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.31. And this muſt needs expreſs the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of it, out of a pit in which there is no bottom, there can be no redemption, but a man muſt ſink and ſinks for ever, it is eternity to the bottom, there are pits here in which men may be caſt, not only into the priſon but into the Sea, or into the Dungeon in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and yet out of all theſe they may be delivered by the blood of the Covenant, and brought out, but this bottomleſs pit there is no blood of the Covenant to redeem from.</p>
            <p>There is a great Gulfe ſet that is by a divine decree ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and fixed, a mans ſtate is ſet for eternity, and there
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:93322:152"/>is no hope of a change, a paſſage here there is from death to life, but there is none here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; for there is a great Gulſe that God has ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, that there can be no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, no change of a mans condition, there can be no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; for <hi>judgment pronounced againſt a man at the laſt day is eternal judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, If a man that is under this torment would come forth, there be Chains caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to keep him under that darkneſs;
<note place="margin">Jude 6.</note> ſo that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſcape, as <hi>Jude</hi> ſayes, the Angels that kept not their firſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate but left their own habitation, are kept in Chains under darkneſs, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> they are kept in Chains, that is, the Judgment of God and the power of God, <hi>ſignificat po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam Dei quâ tanqnam vincu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis aeternis &amp; nunquam ſolvendis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſtius</note> and it is under darkneſs either in Hell, the darkneſs there, or under the darkneſs and the guilty thoughts
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:93322:152"/>of their own ſpirits; now under both theſe the Devils are already, and this is the wrath, and theſe are the Chains that are prepared for all the ſeed of the Serpent which ſhall torment them.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, This fire can never goe out, becauſe there will be for ever a ſupply of the fuel; now if there be always combuſtble matter added to fire here, the fire will never go out, but in this there will be always a ſupply; the fire will ſtill have an addition of fuel, and of blowing, <hi>the pile thereof is fire and much wood,
<note place="margin">ſa. 30.33</note> the breath of the Lord like a ſtream of Brimſtone doth kindle it,</hi> &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies not barely a ſtream, but a torrent, a flood, a violent and ſwift-running ſtream, from much waters and Brimſtone is the moſt fierce burning for fire to work upon, and it is moſt hardly quenched, and a River, a Torrent of Brimſtone, the wrath of the Lord <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> burning in it, the fuel is the wrath of God as a River of Brimſtone burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it, as in this life the ſpirit
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:93322:153"/>of God in a work of grace is not only fire, but oil, it is maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſupplied by the ſame grace, and the ſame ſpirit, and is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by it, ſo after this life the ſpirit of God will not only be fire, but a River of brimſtone, and their will be a dayly maintanance, a continual ſupply of the ſame wrath for ever, therefore that fire can never be quenched.</p>
            <p>Let us now look in the grounds of this eternity, and that the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe there is a principal in the minds of men ready to tax the Lord of cruelty and injuſtice, that he ſhould for the ſins of a few years, lay upon men puniſhment and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to eternity, the acts tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and but for a moment, that the wrath of God ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent and never end; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay they, theſe things cannot fland with the juſtice of God, or with his mercy, therefore they conceive that men ſhall be but puniſhed for a time, and a time
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:93322:153"/>for their deliverance will come when this worm ſhall dye, and this fire ſhall be quenched, and ſome ſay the perſons ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and others that they be annihelated, as the Socinians and divers deſperate Libertines at this day, that will never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that it can agree with the merciful nature of God, to make creatures eternally to deſtroy them for a few acts of ſin, committed a few years here in this life; and <hi>Origen</hi> was ſo merciful in this kind, that he would have the Devil ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved after ſome years, and Hell fire to be wholly put out: and <hi>Austin</hi> in his time had to do, <hi>cum miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricordibus quibuſdam qui nolunt credere poenam ſempiternam futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi> &amp;c. But that men after ſome certain time ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered; <hi>de civet. L.</hi> 21. <hi>c.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>Now, The grounds of this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of wrath are theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Gods intention from eternity was to ſhew his wrath,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:93322:154"/>and to make his power known unto the veſſels of wrath; <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21.22. All men are in his hand, as clay in the hand of the potter; and it is in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make them veſſels of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or diſhonour. Now if the Lord will ſhew the riches of his glory and of his mercy, unto the veſſels of mercy, it muſt be to eternity, and to everlaſting life; ſo if the Lord will ſhew forth the power of his wrath, it muſt be to eternity, for the one muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the other, and if there be eternal mercy to manifeſt the one, there will require eternal wrath to ſhew forth the other; for there are but two things in which the love of God is ſeen, and in which his wrath is ſeen, and they are things ſpiritual unto the ſouls of men: No man can do good to the ſoul, but God, and no man can inflict puniſhment upon the ſoul but God, men may hurt the body, and they have no more that they can do; and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:93322:154"/>in eternal good things, or evil things, thoſe that concerne the life to come; for truely a man cannot know love or hatred by all that is before him here, the ſoul muſt have an eternity to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, all evils in this life which have an end, are too low, and too ſhort to puniſh the ſoul with, as all good things in this life, are too narrow to cover the ſoul with: <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The Covenant by which they are bound over unto this wrath is an eternal Covenant, an everlaſting Covenant, there are two heads, or two publick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, a firſt and a ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> under whom, as by the ſons of <hi>Noah</hi> the whole Earth is over ſpread; and with theſe two Covenants made as with two heads, and there are two ſorts of men, the elect, and the unregenerate, children of the bond-woman and of the free, and there are two deſtinct places, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hell anſwerable unto theſe, and one Covenant is everlaſting,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:93322:155"/>as well as the other, not only the covenant of Grace, but the covenant of Works alſo; and therefore the curſe of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant remains upon men unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and they are bound over unto eternal wrath,
<note place="margin">Gal. 10. Deut. 29.21.</note> as the Lord Chriſt has put an end unto this Covenant, and aboliſhed it unto all that are in him, being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf made under it, and ſatisfying the precept and the curſe of it, and ſo he did cancel it as a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing againſt us nailing, it unto his Croſs; <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. And ſo they that are in Chriſt are freed from the Law as a Covenant, but unto all other men it remains a Covenant ſtill, and they remain under the curſe of it for ever, and the wrath of God abides upon them;
<note place="margin">Joh. 3.36.</note> 
               <hi>for the Goſpel doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly bring them under wrath but leaves them under it for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The guilt and ſtain of ſin upon the ſoul is eternal alſo, the act of ſin is tranſient, <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum quod delectat,</hi> &amp;c. But
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:93322:155"/>the guilt of ſin is permanent, the relation between God and the creature is eternal, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is an eternal obligation upon the creature, becauſe he is bound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God by an eternal Law, and the tranſgreſſion of that Law car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with it an eternal guilt, there is not a ſin that a man commits, but it is laid up amongſt the Lords Treaſures,
<note place="margin">Deut. Jer. 17.1.</note> and it is alſo laid up in their own Conſciences, ſin is a debt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.12. Which will as all other debts are, be ever due till it be paid; if it be a thouſand years ſince it was committed, yet it due ſtill, and the continuance of the time will never wear it out amongſt men, much leſs will it being before the Lord and God keeps his debt-books, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.6. <hi>Behold it is written before me, I will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence it, even recompence it into their boſome;</hi> &amp;c. And there is an utter inability in us to pay the debt we owe to God, or to make him any ſatisfaction; we have nothing to pay, and not one
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:93322:156"/>drop of the blood of Chriſt ſhall go to pay any part of thy debt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ing once caſt into priſon, and thou ſhalt not come out thence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once caſt into Priſon, till thou haſt paid the uttermoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and ſatisfaction thou canſt never make, for the offence is againſt an infinite God, and thou art but a finite creature, and here is thy miſery; that <hi>becauſe thou canſt never ſatisfie fully, therefore thou muſt be for ever ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying;</hi> all that thou canſt do will not blot out one ſin, there is nothing but the blood of Chriſt can do it; when all the world was drowned by a floud, it could not waſh away the guilt of ſin; and when it ſhall be on fire, it ſhall not be able to purge one ſin; and when a man ſhall lye in Hell for ever, even the fire of Hell cannot purge the ſoul of one ſin: <hi>Ignis infernalis non eſt purgatorius ſed punitorius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, God after this Life, ſhall not only reward men accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:93322:156"/>to their actions, but their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and the deſires of their hearts: Now, mens deſires unto ſin are infinite and eternal; if they could live for ever, they would ſin for ever, and they are never ſatisfied with ſinning; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is compared unto drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<note place="margin">Deut. 29.</note> a man adds drunkenneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thirſt, and none do call in for Wine ſo faſt as they that have had too much already; and it is as Hell that cannot be ſatisfied: <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Fifthly, Becauſe they never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent but are hardned in the ſame way of ſinning, they remain the ſame men ſtill, and have the ſame will unto evil unto eternity in Hell, that they had when they were here upon earth; ſo that if God ſhould take a man out of Hell, and ſet him upon the earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, with a poſſibility of mercy, he would go on in the ſame way of ſinning with as much greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and more then ever he did in the time of his Life, for this is a rule amongſt many of the School-men, <hi>voluntas morientis confirmatur, in eo ſtatu in quo moritur.</hi> And therefore as the Saints in Heaven dying in a ſtate of grace, are <hi>in bono confirmati;</hi> ſo the wicked dying in a ſtate of ſin, are <hi>in malo obfirmati;</hi> that whereas in this life, in wicked men there is an inability to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, yet there is a poſſibility

And therefore Divines do ſay, that in this Life men are ſervants unto ſin, but it is but <hi>ſervitus incho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ata,</hi> but in Hell there ſhall be <hi>ſervitus conſummata,</hi> for here there is ſome reſtraint unto ſin, but there ſhall be none hereafter; but a man ſhall be given over to it, and <hi>the more a man is given over to ſin in this Life, the neerer to Hell he comes.</hi>
